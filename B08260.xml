            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHatever Apologies the World may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for Books of another Nature, I think they ought not to be gratified in Books of this, for whatever tends to <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our converſation,</hi> and advance a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in another World when our hopes fail us here, is ſufficient to recommend it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Its unaccountable, that ſince Religion, in ſpight of all deſigns to undermine and make it look lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, aſſerts its own Authority and make men confeſs its beauties, that they ſhould be ſuch fools as not to be charm'd by them. Since <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity</hi> are become meer Name, and Men are obliged to own a Being, which they have the Impudence to diſobey: It may become a Queſtion, Whether they had not better have continued in their Opinion <hi>that there was no God,</hi> if there were ever any ſuch, than pretend to own a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and pay ſo little reſpect to it: How Men came to diſtruſt the God who made them, or not carefully obſerve him whom they own to be the Maker of the World, are things equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable; that Man, who is endued with Reaſon, and capable to convince himſelf, <hi>that he is not of himſelf,</hi> and that whatever was the Cauſe of him, muſt have a Cauſe, or that that
<pb facs="tcp:180424:6"/>Cauſe muſt be Eternal, and the Maker of all things, who is forced from Natural Principles, and common Arguments, to allow a firſt Cauſe, and that he cou'd not have had this Knowledge if this Cauſe, had not revealed it ſelf: That the ſame reaſon, which inclines him to take any thing for truth of which he han't demonſtration, or to give credit to any thing, obliges him to believe the Account of God, of Religion, and Himſelf, which is delivered in the Scriptures, and for the truth of which there is the beſt Teſtimony in the world. For their Antiquity, there is nothing ſo ancient, and for their Credit, they have the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all Ages, <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> So that if they be true, we ought to give our entire Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to all that is declared, and they teſtifie of One whom God was to ſend to redeem this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful World: For Man fell from what he was created, and ſtood in need of an Attonement; that this Perſon in the fulneſs of time was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to the World, being conceived by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and born of a Virgin; that he wrought Miracles; taught us an exact Rule of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and then laid down his life as a Ranſom for all that ſhould believe on him; that after his death, he raiſed himſelf from the dead, and in the ſight of his Diſciples aſcended into Heaven, and there remains, till he ſhall come to judge the World: That he appointed Apoſtles, and gave them power to make Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, that by ſuch an Order of Men, the Laws which he Commanded might be taught to us, and the Rites of that Religion which he
<pb facs="tcp:180424:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>planted, duly performed. Of this we are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly aſſured, and though we have the witneſs of Men, yet the witneſs of God is greater, and he that can no more deceive than be deceived, has poſitively confirmed. We have had a conſtant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of men in the Prieſtly Office, even to this time, what then is the cauſe of our Diſſenſions, of our Unbelief and Misbelief, but that they who polluted our Manners, wou'd betray our Faith, and make us altogether uncapable of thoſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which theſe Scriptures promiſe us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; why ſuch induſtry to bear down Revealed Religion, but that Men hate the light which wou'd expoſe their Deeds that are Evil. Why are they ſo laborious to defame that Doctrine which has increaſed againſt Oppoſition, and the malice of Hell, and will be preſerved to the end of the World: 'Tis impoſſible to know a God reconciled without revelation, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and is there any that they can prefer to our Saviour, who has the witneſs of the Father and the Holy Ghoſt concerning him. He was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy'd of <hi>3000</hi> Years before, and exactly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Character of him that was to come: What Excuſe then can Men have for their Obſtinacy, who pretend to own a God, and yet won't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the words of his Mouth? Is there any Law, any Precept, any Character misbecoming the <hi>Dignity and Wiſdom of the Son of God?</hi> Has our Saviour ſaid any thing to be the Will of his Father which is not rational, and moſt becoming the Almighty Governor of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth? If not, Why ſhou'd the hearts
<pb facs="tcp:180424:7"/>of the Sons of Men be lifted up, and diſpiſe the D ctates of this <hi>preacher of Righteouſneſs?</hi> If they own a God, can they ſerve him in a more acceptable manner? Can they propoſe better Rules of Converſation, be govern'd by better Laws, be better Men than the Scripture can make them? If there is nothing in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture misbecoming an infinite Wiſdom, and they declare to us the Will of God, which is, that we ſhou'd believe and obey his Son, why ſhou'd we refuſe to ſerve him, as he himſelf thinks fit? So little reaſon has the <hi>Deiſt</hi> for his Opinion, that 'tis impoſſible to eſtabliſh it, unleſs we deſtroy that by which we came to know there is a God, which no Man cou'd have done without Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Impreſſions upon his Soul, or explicit Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. So that it is to live unaccountably, to believe they know not why, but do what ſeems Good in their own Eyes, and every man to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a Being which he reveals to himſelf, which being impoſſible is to live in the poſſeſſion of <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd Principles,</hi> and which are not anſwerable to the common Reaſon of Mankind.</p>
            <p>But theſe are not the only Perſons who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to Religion, for that ſuffers like our ſelves, moſt by thoſe who pretend to be our Friends; the Wiſdom of God ſo far condeſcended to our weakneſs, as to make himſelf known in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner. When <hi>our firſt Parents fell,</hi> ſin entred into the World, and Death by ſin, for in them all Men were made ſinners; if our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents transgreſſed, we muſt derive a contagion from their Loins, for who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean, and if we are conceived and
<pb facs="tcp:180424:7"/>born in Sin, what is Man that he ſhould be clean or he that is born of a Woman, that he ſhould be Righteous: God ſaw this, and knew our inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, that we ſhould incline to Evil, and cou'd have no merit to attone his Juſtice, for what cou'd the Sons of Violence offer that was clean, or Man, miſerable Man, propoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore himſelf to the favour of God. But God was pleaſed to propoſe a ſacrifice, to take away the ſins of the World, and this he declared as ſoon as Man had ſin'd, and continued to inculeate this Goodneſs in the minds of Men by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> who continually declare the mercy of God which ſhould appear to bring <hi>Salvation;</hi> this is what <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, and 'twas imputed unto him for <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> for he <hi>ſaw the Day, and was Glad:</hi> This was it that was typifyed by the Ceremonies of the <hi>Law,</hi> that every time they Sacrificed and Worſhipped in the <hi>Temple,</hi> they might have ſomething to put them in mind of their <hi>Meſſia,</hi> whom they expected, and who was called the <hi>Wonderful Counſel, or the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace;</hi> that his Office was to viſit and redeem his <hi>People.</hi> Thus did God prepare the way for his <hi>Son,</hi> that we might reverence him, and though his Dignity was thus great, yet he was to be rejected and diſpiſed by <hi>Men,</hi> ſmitten of <hi>God,</hi> that the Chaſtiſement of our Peace might be upon him, and by his <hi>Stripes</hi> we might be Healed. This indeed was wonderfull, and what proved <hi>a ſtumbling block to the</hi> Jews, <hi>and fooliſhneſs to the</hi> Gentiles, and what they who in this Age continue to deny the
<pb facs="tcp:180424:8"/>Lord who bought them, think very Ridiculous: But however merry theſe Gentlemen of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion are with the <hi>price of their Salvation.</hi> I believe it would ſtartle them to have it ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly put to them, whether they renounce the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of that <hi>Croſs</hi> which they diſpiſe, or <hi>the Name into which they were Baptized;</hi> we are certain it can be no jeſting matter, if the <hi>Scriptures</hi> don't err concerning Him, for they tell us, he died for our ſins, and roſe again for our juſtification, and that without him, we have no life in us; that he is our <hi>Advocate,</hi> and was made a propitiation for our Sins, and yet that he was from <hi>Eternity;</hi> for he came down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and was in the <hi>Beginning,</hi> and was with <hi>God,</hi> and was <hi>God,</hi> and yet became <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and dwelt among us, that even in this State, he was worthy of Divine Honour, by virtue of that <hi>Union</hi> in him, of the Divine and Humane Nature that he was <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega;</hi> that in the beginning he laid the Foundations of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and all the Sons of <hi>God</hi> ſhouted for joy; therefore let us take heed to the things which we have heard, leaſt at any time we let them ſlip, and then, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi> And who then can deny that this <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as the <hi>Scriptures</hi> explain it, is <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> to whom be Glory for ever. And yet there are a ſort of Men, who ſet up themſelves in contradiction to this Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Godlineſs, and fancy by ſearching, they can find out the Almighty to perfection, who pride themſelves in Reaſon, and think it a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for any thing to be above their Knowledge.
<pb facs="tcp:180424:8"/>They are ſo refin'd in their Notions, that they can ſee no difference between a thing, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their reaſon, and being contrary to it: They are ſo great Maſters, that not to underſtand a thing, or its being repugnant in its ſelf are the ſame thing, for with them all is Non-ſcence and contradiction, which they don't comprehend; when at the ſame time they can't give an <hi>account of themſelves,</hi> and yet would be thought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand every thing elſe. The <hi>Scripture</hi> more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly is their Talent, and if we can believe them, there is nothing <hi>like a Myſtery in it,</hi> but they can eaſily comprehend all, or as eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: That our Saviour was conceived by the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt,</hi> and Born of a <hi>Virgin</hi> is poſſitive in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but what they never yet made eaſie to our conceptions, but in ſuch a manner as gives the lie to the Prediction, and wretchedly perverts the Senſe of the Scripture, by leaving it more perplex'd and above our reach than 'tis of it ſelf. That he was the expreſs Image of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and therefore to him every <hi>Knee ſhould bow,</hi> that all Power in Heaven and Earth was given unto him, and therefore if we do not believe in him <hi>ſhall be Damn'd.</hi> That he came out from God, and that he and the Father are one, and therefore is able to hear our Prayers, and has promiſed if we ask of him he will give us, and yet that took upon him the form of a Servant, is what God has Teſtified, and what he thought was not too much for our ſake, though in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he thought it not Robery to be equal with God, and of this there are three that bear Record in <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:180424:9"/>Ghoſt,</hi> and that theſe three are one; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this truth are we commanded to be <hi>Baptized,</hi> for 'twas his will that all Nations ſhould be Taught and Baptiſed in the Name of the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> theſe are all infallible Truths, whether they underſtand them or not, if they cannot, then there are Myſteries, and what they muſt believe without knowing any more than that <hi>God</hi> with whom all things are poſſible has ſaid it, and if we would be ſaved muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that we have all ſin'd and ſtand in need of a <hi>Saviour,</hi> is what our Reaſon and Scripture informs us; the Perſon and Dignity of this <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> the Scripture poſſitively aſſerts, and if that be true, he could not be leſs than God that undertook our Redemption, and that had thoſe peculiar attributes belonging to him; but how he the <hi>God-head</hi> and <hi>Man-hood</hi> was united in him, is not what his Wiſdom has thought fit to reveal, and what our finite underſtanding is not capable of, and what is not neceſſary to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that we ſhould know, but believe: So that the Controverſie ſeems to be this, whether <hi>God can oblige us to believe what we can't comprehend?</hi> And whether he has not obliged us already to a Faith which muſt be obedient to his word, till they can prove to our reaſon, that either of theſe are untrue or impoſſible? Let it ſuffice us to h ld faſt the Faith in which we are bred up, and only believe as much as God has been pleaſed to reveal, and have regard to what the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſay concerning him, through whom are are to have <hi>everlaſting Life.</hi> Thus much is certain, and what I think to be an unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:180424:9"/>Argument, and a juſt account of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Belief,</hi> which a Great <hi>Divine</hi> of our Church has lately offer'd. That the Foundation of the Doctrine of the Trinity is this; Firſt, That <hi>there can be but one God;</hi> Secondly, <hi>That there is nothing in God, but what is God;</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That there can be no compoſition in the Deity with any ſuch poſitive real Being diſtinct from the Deity it ſelf. But the Church finding in Scripture mention of three to whom diſtinctly the God-head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, expreſſed theſe three by the Name of Perſons, and ſtated their Perſonallity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three diſtinct Modes of ſubſiſtance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to one and the ſame God-head, and theſe alſo diſtinguiſhed from one another by three diſtinct Relations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now what deſigns theſe Traducers of the Lord of Glory can intend, by puzelling themſelves and every Body elſe with their pretentions to <hi>more Reaſon</hi> than God has given them, I can't imagine, unleſs under the diſguiſe of Charity to our Reaſon, they would ſubvert our Religion, and by pretending to bring the ſublime Truths of God's Word to our underſtanding, they would Ridicule the hidden things of God, and ſo open a way for <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Inſidellity,</hi> by denying firſt that there is any thing which our reaſon can't comprehend, and then that there is nothing in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but what can eaſily be underſtood. This is to make <hi>our Reaſon,</hi> not the <hi>Scripture</hi> a rule of Salvation, and when once our ſenſe is to judge of theſe Divine Truths, all of them that we can give a Mathematical Account of,
<pb facs="tcp:180424:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>muſt be rejected: And yet that there are ſuch truths of which they can have no Idea is certain, and after all, they muſt own, that either they are not to be underſtood, and yet believed, or elſe that they are Non-ſence and contradiction, which is an impudence they dare not publickly own, and what would be fatal to their deſigns; for the <hi>Socinian</hi> needs only appear in his proper Colour, to make him abhor'd and rejected by all, and lookt upon as an Enemy to God, Religion and the common ſence of Mankind.</p>
            <p>But there is yet another ſort, who pretend an Obedience to the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and yet make that eaſie rule of <hi>Salvation</hi> ſo confuſed and perplex'd, that either they dare not, or cannot give an account of their <hi>Faith.</hi> Their principles, if they have any, are as unaccountable to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as to the World, and they agree in nothing ſo much as to oppoſe the plain ſenſe of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> are poſitive Inſtitutions, the one to be perform'd by <hi>Water</hi> in the <hi>Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the other by <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> in remembrance of our Saviour's Death and Sufferings, are as plainly and poſitively commanded, as any one thing in the Scripture. That the <hi>Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians</hi> made it their Practiſe, is capable of the ſame proof as the Scriptures themſelves; they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Preaching the Lord Jeſus, and Baptiſing all that believed in his Name, and the condition of Salvation in thoſe days, was <hi>Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> that to ſtrengthen People
<pb facs="tcp:180424:10"/>in their Faith, they meet on the firſt day in the Week to break Bread, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> is very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to inſtruct our Behaviour, that we might receive the Bread of the Lord worthily.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding this, as if an aukerd Gravity, and ſullenneſs of Behaviour were to paſs for Authority, they pretend by a <hi>New Light</hi> to another underſtanding of the Scripture, and impudently prevert that Senſe which the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church</hi> for <hi>1600</hi> Years and more ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too. So unwilling are they to go to Heaven in the ſteps of their Fathers, that they prefer eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wild <hi>Enthuſiaſtick Notion</hi> to the written Word of God, and ſo fearful of following the Examples of Tradition that each Man ſets up for a Rule to himſelf; they have no <hi>Prieſts as well as no Sacraments,</hi> no ſettled conſtitution of a Church, and are ſo little obſervers of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Command, to do all things <hi>with Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Order,</hi> as if he did not ſpeak it by the Spirit, but to gratifie his own Superſtition; they live as if the Goſpel was all Privilege, and no Duty, are Enemies to a form in Divine Worſhip, and in ſpight of the Scripture which commands Women to be in ſilence, will needs have them for Speakers among them; thus do they play at <hi>croſs purpoſes with the Word of God,</hi> and by their Obſtinancy and Fantaſticalneſs, make it of none effect. But there is an Argument againſt them, which they never thought fit to anſwer, and till they can, muſt be thought Enemies to the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt:</hi> An Ordinance once enjoyn'd and never repeal'd, is ſtill in force; but <hi>Baptiſm</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:180424:11"/>by <hi>Water</hi> was once enjoyn'd, but never repeal'd: <hi>Ergo,</hi> and ſo of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper,</hi> and what ever elſe is accounted an Ordinance in the Church of God, and all that lies upon us to prove, is, That what we aſſert is an Ordinance, and was enjoyn'd by lawful Authority; and this is what the <hi>Scriptures</hi> prove themſelves, and what has been ſtrengthen'd by the Arguments and Practiſe of the Church down to this day. So that if there is any ſuch thing as <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> falſe <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and denyers of the <hi>Doctrine of Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, we may find them in this wretched Sect of pretenders to Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>But now among theſe who have no knowledge of the <hi>Truth,</hi> or hold it in Unrighteouſneſs, <hi>or put Godlineſs into a Form</hi> to draw the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule and ſcorn of the World, its no wonder to meet with them Debauch'd, or fill'd with Pride, Conceit and Devilliſhneſs, or Deceitful, truſting in themſelves <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> turning the truth of God into a lie. But that we who are Born in a Nation, where the <hi>true Religion is Eſtabliſhed by Law,</hi> and have all the Advantages which God can give us to make us Happy. Our Church teaching us the form of ſound Words once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to the Saints, and makes <hi>the Word of God her Rule of Faith,</hi> the Example of the <hi>Apoſtles and Primitive Fathers her Guide,</hi> and her conſtitution ſuch as Decency directs, that we in the midſt of ſuch aſſiſtances ſhould fail of the end of Creation, and in the ſpight of God's Grace and Mercy, deprive our ſelves of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs, by living in Diſobedience to this Church, in contradiction to the word of God,
<pb facs="tcp:180424:11"/>and in defiance of what our reaſon tells us is both our intereſt and duty. Whence is this hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, that Men forget they were <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed,</hi> and live as if they never heard of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> Let us all put the Queſtion to our ſelves, and ſee whether one Reaſon of this Stupidity and Wickedneſs is not from our Neglect, in the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of thoſe committed to our Charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are dedicated to God and Religion as ſoon as Born,</hi> according to the command of our Saviour; but ſince moſt of us are borought to the Church, when through our tender Years we are not capable to judge nor perform what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us. The Church according to an Ancient Preſcription has appointed <hi>Sureties</hi> in our behalf; they ſolemnly Engage for us till we come to an Age that we are able to take care of our ſelves. Whence is it then, that notwithſtanding this Prudent care of the Church, ſo few are bred up to thoſe Pious Rules preſcribed in our <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and how many leſs when they come to Age, think themſelves bound to perform what was vow'd in their Names. Do they who are <hi>God-fathers</hi> perform their part? Do they endeavor early to inſtruct their Children, and inform them to what advantages they are Born, that they promiſed by them who are their <hi>Sureties</hi> to perform their duty to God and their Neighbour; that now they are able, they are to be accountable for their own Actions, and take upon them that Solemn Engagement to <hi>Fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt's Banner, and to reſiſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and to believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi> Thus much is certainly incumbent upon ſuch as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb facs="tcp:180424:12"/>for <hi>Infants</hi> at leaſt, that they put the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in mind to do it for them, ſo that there is no ſuch difficulty that ſhould diſcourage any from ſo charitable a Work, but there is danger for thoſe who take it upon them with no deſign, but to comply with the cuſtom, but not to inform them of good and Evil; and, Oh, how happy ſhould we be, if when we firſt come to the knowledge of Good and Evil, that we could ſo perſue the Good, that God may not deny us the privilege of taſting of the Tree of Life alſo.</p>
            <p>Do they who are Parents perform their part by confirming the <hi>Advice of the God-fathers</hi> to their Children, in adding both their Precept and Example. The Church has appointed <hi>God-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> to be as Monitors, but 'tis they that will be accountable for the miſmanagement of their Children, for they have a conſtant Eye over them, and their Authority laſt as long as their lives, and if thro' their Negligence, their Children are loſt, their Blood will be required at their hands. 'Twas a ſevere Judgment upon Old <hi>Eli,</hi> for not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the right of a Parent in the correction of his Sons, tho' he was not altogether ſilent at their wickedneſs, but mild in his reproof, and yet God removed from him the Prieſt-hood for ever. But how many are there that don't ſay ſo much as he did? My Sons, ye do not well to make the Lords's People to Tranſgreſs, but are rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them in their Vices, or ſilent at their Wickedneſs. <hi>Good God, that Men ſhould deſire Children to make them miſerable!</hi> Surely it concerns us as much as it did the <hi>Jews,</hi> to bring them up in the fear and Nature of the
<pb facs="tcp:180424:12"/>Lord. Why ſhould we be cautious in our Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when 'tis our Duty, and their Intereſt, to hear and to obey, and we have this for our Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they are diſobedient, the Laws of the Land are ready to our aſſiſtance in the puniſhment of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Vice, and we have this Negative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to reſtrain them from being very bad, if we can't make them very Good.</p>
            <p>We are born into a World full of Temptations and Miſeries, and tho' God has pronounced it good, as the work of his hands, yet we are ſo prone to do amiſs, that we ſcarce arrive to the power of acting, but we incline to pervert that Bleſſing, and make that our Curſe, which was deſign'd our Happineſs. 'Tis the Goodneſs and Mercy of God that we are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a power to Will, and he has placed in us ſuch an inclination to good, as may be infinitly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by getting in us the upper-hand of <hi>Evil,</hi> and a power to overcome the ſubtilties of the <hi>World, the Fleſh, and the Devil;</hi> let us then make uſe of this <hi>Power</hi> which God has given us, and they who are Young, look up to God to preſerve their <hi>Innocence;</hi> and they who are ſo unhappy as to have been over taken by the Enemy of Mankind, let them now at length call their ways to remembrance, and turn their face unto God's Teſtimonies; to this end, let them according to the Direction of a great Man:</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Conſider what they have done amiſs,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>What is fitting for them now to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>If they do it not, what the end of their neglect will be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Examination conſiſts in a review of their paſt life, as to their <hi>Actions,</hi> all that they have left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
<pb facs="tcp:180424:13"/>as well as done; as to their <hi>Faith,</hi> whatever they disbelieved that is true, or believed that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs; and this is no eaſie task, it requires <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Pains, Zeal</hi> and <hi>Conſtancy,</hi> if their own Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has not given them the advantage of directing themſelves, let them addreſs themſelves to ſome <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Miniſter;</hi> let us firſt conſider the neceſſity of Repentance, and then the difficulties, and they are more than we can preſently imagin. <hi>Our luſts are not to be conquer'd by a Sigh, a Tear, or a Reſolution, when we are in a fit of Devotion;</hi> but let the difficulty be greater than our imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muſt reſolve to undertake the Combate, and root out every habit and diſpoſition to ſin: In order to it, let us <hi>firſt know what is fitting for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and then what is fit for our practice;</hi> for if we build upon a true Foundation, our Faith will direct us to work out our Salvation by a true <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> if we ſuffer our ſelves to be deceiv'd by any <hi>known ſin,</hi> we are not in ſafty, and 'tis not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance when we repeat our Wickedneſs, and we have not conquer'd our luſts till we are able to reſiſt them; he who thinks he may go to Heaven, becauſe he is <hi>Honeſt</hi> in the main, or is one the world calls a <hi>Moral Man,</hi> is in danger of Eternal Ruin; the <hi>Young Man in the Goſpel had kept all the Commandments from his Youth, and yet lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one thing needfull to make him perfect;</hi> and the reaſon of this purity is plain, for the ſame diſpoſitions which we have when we leave this World, will follow us to the next; we are miſtaken if we ſuppoſe that with this Body we ſhall put off the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſin; or, becauſe we die in a fit of Devotion, that
<pb facs="tcp:180424:13"/>God will accept of this laſt part of our life, and not account for the reſt. Our Souls will have the ſame affections in the other World, as here, for there can be no alteration, <hi>as the Tree falls ſo it lies,</hi> and if we reſolve not to endeavour a change till Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach us, and think that our Reflections upon a Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed are ſufficient to attone a miſpent life, we ſhall be miſerably deceived: It is certain indeed <hi>that a true Repentance, though never ſo late will be accepted,</hi> but who can be certain that he ſhall tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent at a time when he is not fit for the ordinary Offices of life, when his Soul is upon the Wing, and ready to take its flight into another World. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance includes more then can be done in ſuch a dreadful Extremity;</hi> it implies not only that part which many endeavour at that time to act, by moving all about them with their Tears and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, but an abſolute change in their whole Man. Who can ſatisfie himſelf that his heart is right towards God, when he has not an opportunity to <hi>try and examine his ſincerity?</hi> Can any Man be ſecure that if he ſhould live, that his Vices would not return with his Health, ſince 'twas neceſſity, not choice, that drove him to theſe <hi>new Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and if he cannot, what unanſwerable folly is it to defer what reaſon and every Man's Conſcience ſuggeſt ought preſently to be done; <hi>let us then not truſt to uncertainty,</hi> but ſince God gives an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to be happy, not make our ſelves miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; let us caſt off the Old Man with his Deeds, and betake our ſelves to a <hi>newneſs of life;</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us in this work, let us ſet our Faces <hi>towards the Altar of God,</hi> for 'tis there we are to receive ſtrength and comfort, and every good thing. This
<pb facs="tcp:180424:14"/>is what we obliged our ſelves to at our <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and ſince we have lived unworthy of the Firſt <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> let us in <hi>Humiliation and Repentance</hi> approach the Second, that our ſins may be blotted out, and we may be made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in Light; and now if any ask what preparation we ought to make, I anſwer: I know of no other than what I have endeavoured to perſwade, and what is neceſſary and reaſonable, even a true <hi>Faith and Repentance;</hi> that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a Duty, is generally acknowledg'd, yet through miſtakes there are abundance neglect it. Our Saviour was very particular in this Order to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and his Apoſtles devoutly preſs it in all their Writings, and the Ancients received it as an ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Bleſſing. We are told, that unleſs we <hi>Eat Chriſt's Body, and drink his Blood, we have no life in us,</hi> and that this is to be done by Bread and Wine in the <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> is what the Apoſtles and generality of Mankind down to this Age have believed. Chriſt, when he gave it them, told them, it was his Body, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs our Behaviour, that we might not receive it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, but diſcern it as the Lord's body, and therefore firſt, <hi>to Examine our ſelves, and then Eat of that Bread, and Drink of that Cup,</hi> what then ſhould hinder our approaches to this <hi>Holy Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet; that we are wicked</hi> is no excuſe, for why are we not otherwiſe; <hi>that we are affraid, becauſe of our unworthineſs;</hi> if there is no other reaſon but our fear, is no Excuſe. For 'tis not the ſenſe of our unworthineſs that ſhould hinder us, but our <hi>reſolution, or unwillingneſs, to be otherwiſe,</hi> and that indeed will make us unworthy for ever;
<pb facs="tcp:180424:14"/>for, where ſhall we be waſhed, if not in this Fountain which is opened for Sin and Uncleanneſs? If none but ſuch as are <hi>perfect</hi> could approach this Holy Table, who then would venture to come near? And what can we think of our Saviour, that could propoſe a Snare to endanger our Ruin? No, it was ordain'd for ſuch as had <hi>a ſenſe of their Unworthineſs,</hi> and were ſenſible of their load, but deſired to be eaſed of their heavy burthen; <hi>Well, but they who come to the Sacrament are obliged to live ſtricter lives than other Men, and ſome are affraid they can't conform to an exactneſs of Converſation.</hi> Why are they not as well affraid, that becauſe they don't lead ſuch lives, that they ſhall be puniſhed, which would be an argument to put them upon that Tryal, and when once they ſaw the pleaſantneſs of the paths of Righteouſneſs, they would endeavour to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in them? Beſides, they are not obliged, but to lead ſuch lives as is neceſſary to Salvation, and how dares any Man that believes another World do leſs? There is danger indeed in <hi>unworthy Receiving,</hi> and there is as great <hi>a danger in ſtaying away,</hi> both of them are a contempt of the Lord's Body, and will receive their reward; in ſhort, whatever our <hi>Scruples</hi> are that hinder us from this Ordinance, let us with all ſpeed endeavour to remove them, for there is no excuſe for <hi>our Abſcence,</hi> nor any obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but what may eaſily be anſwered, if we are ſincere in our inquiries; 'tis the <hi>neglect of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> that is the cauſe of our coldneſs in Religion, and I can't tell how it comes to paſs, that tho' the <hi>Church and State</hi> requires all that are at the Age of Sixteen to communicate at leaſt three times in the Year, that there is not one in a Thouſand obſerve the
<pb facs="tcp:180424:15"/>order; there are a great many conſiderate perſons that <hi>never ſeem to have a deſire after it,</hi> till they come upon their Death-bed, and then are willing to have it to conduct them to Heaven. The <hi>Ancient Church</hi> refuſed to Adminiſter to any that had not received it before, and if the diſcipline was maintained, it would make us more circumſpect; for a great many think if they can have the <hi>Miniſter to pray by them, and give them the Sacrament, all will be well:</hi> But if they who refuſed it in their Health, were deny'd it upon their Death-bed, it would be a dreadful warning to others not to neglect it, and thoſe Miniſters who venture now to Adminſter it, tranſgreſs the <hi>Rubrick</hi> in this caſe; but 'tis as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet to truſt to This now, as to depend upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, begun at ſuch a time which is hardly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be ſincere, and if not, they are loſt for ever; there are the ſame Arguments to bring Men to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as there are to perſwade them to a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, without both we are not aſſured of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and he that pretends to lead a life accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God's Holy Word, and yet refuſes to eat of the Bread which came down from Heaven, how can he hope to be raiſed up at the laſt day? <hi>The truth on't is, Men are not willing to part with their Luſts,</hi> and as long as they are in that mind, they do well to ſtay away, but do very ill to continue in ſuch a reſolution; but what ſhall we ſay, if neither <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or Threats, Rewards or Puniſhments, Heaven or Hell,</hi> will perſwade Men to forſake their ſins, nothing will; however we muſt never be weary in well doing, and 'tis our Duty to exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daily, which was the chief inducement of this, <hi>Advice to thoſe which never Receiv'd the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:180424:15"/>and this I thought I cou'd not do in a better manner than by ſhewing, Firſt, <hi>the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of Sin, and then,</hi> Secondly, <hi>the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Repentance;</hi> to this end I have collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a form of Devotion which may be uſeful in our Converſion, and when we are ſo happy as to be ſenſible of the folly of our ways, that we can ſet before us the <hi>difficulty of returning,</hi> and yet dare venture thro' all hardſhips to attain Salvation. I thought it neceſſary to add <hi>ſome Arguments to oblige us to that Duty,</hi> which is our intereſt to comply with, and which will ſtrengthen our reſolutions in Piety; to theſe <hi>Directions,</hi> I have collected another form of preparitory Devotions to be uſed at any time before we <hi>approach the Sacrament,</hi> and left it to the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's</hi> Diſcretion to uſe as much of it, and as often as he pleaſes. That our <hi>behaviour in the Church</hi> might be anſwerable to the Solemnity, there is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a large Form of Devotion, and I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to <hi>range them in a ſuitable Order,</hi> that every Prayer having a particular relation to what we are then a doing, our Minds might be more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and our Souls thus aſcending with our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we may pray by the Spirit, and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alſo. I'm very willing to believe, that all who come to this Holy Table, endeavour to be as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout as they can, and 'tis poſſible, fancy themſelves very Zealous, if they preſcribe their thoughts to that which is <hi>good in general,</hi> and no doubt 'tis very well if they have ſo much victory over themſelves, as to curb their thoughts and deſires; but if by any other helps they can arrive yet farther, and not only when they <hi>enter the Church, leave the thoughts of the World behind,</hi> but can place ſuch as are ſuitable
<pb facs="tcp:180424:16"/>in their room, 'tis not only their vertue, but duty; we are to conſider that we are come to remember Chriſt, and that all our Thoughts ought to bend themſelves to ſuch holy Meditations; we ſhould as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>pry into theſe Myſteries which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels deſire to look into,</hi> and thus by not only ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king words with us when we enter the Houſe of God, but directions for our Thoughts too, we might not be in danger to offer up the ſacrifice of Fools. To theſe <hi>Devotions in the Church</hi> I have added ſome for our behaviour at Home, for 'tis neceſſary to keep our affections <hi>in a heat afterwards, as to kindle them before;</hi> beſides, I had this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in it, to inform ſome, who by their <hi>practiſe</hi> don't ſeem to know any more, than that we are to be ſerious while we are about this Solemnity, and as ſoon as 'tis over, forget their Reſolutions and the Obligations they have put upon themſelves, by <hi>Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drinking before the Lord.</hi> We come there to receive Grace to help up to perform our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of amendment, as well as to receive pardon for our paſt Offences, and unleſs we come with this deſign, we can have no <hi>Abſolution,</hi> and I would to God, that we all did approach this Table with ſuch Reſolutions: In order to it this <hi>Collection of Devotions</hi> is humbly offer'd, and if it ſhall pleaſe God to make it an inſtrument, but to <hi>convert one ſinner,</hi> or add a zeal to any ſincere Chriſtian, it will abundantly recompence my trouble, and to God alone be the Praiſe.</p>

            <head>ADVICE To thoſe who never Receiv'd the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>OUR Saviour has propoſed <hi>Two Sacraments,</hi> as neceſſary to Salvation, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> has taken care in her Chatechiſm to inſtruct thoſe bred in her Communion to perform both, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Command of her great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver: So that as ſoon as we are taught to Read, we may learn our Duty to God, our Neighbor, and ourſelves, and this for a very wiſe reaſon, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may grow up with us, that we mayn't be to learn our Duty when we ſhould practiſe it. But 'tis the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a great many People, that they could give a better account of their Faith when they were Children, than at the Age of Diſcretion. They invert the Example of the Apoſtle, when they are become men, begin to take upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:180424:17"/>them the Childiſh things; they think what was taught them in their Youth was only fitting for Children to know, and don't become the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of their graver years, till their neglect brings them almonſt to that neceſſity, of going to School to learn Wiſdom from Babes, and get under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding from them that have hardly any knowledge: They have not only forgot what is required of them who come to the Lord's Supper, but are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the meaning of it too. This is owing in great meaſure to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral neglect of Religion; we live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out concern, have no other Thoughts but for the preſent, ſuffer our ſelves to be hurried on by our perverted Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and are without God in the World. So miſerably do we expoſe our ſelves by folly, and inconſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we neither think of our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here nor hereafter; and becauſe we are ſo Mad to live like Brutes, to fancy we ſhall periſh like them that have no Underſtanding, but let us not deceive our Souls, Religion is no <hi>Chimera,</hi> and Heaven is worth thinking on. For this end we came into the World, and what is ſo manifeſtly our Duty, ought to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:180424:17"/>be the buſineſs of our lives. <hi>They who have neglected, or are ignorant of it, ought to inform themſelves, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their Sin and Diſobedience.</hi> No man ought to think himſelf too Old, or Wiſe, to be inſtructed; eſpecially in Religion we may always be improving, and when intereſt joins with our Duty it ſhould be no hard matter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us into a compliance. There are very few but are perſwaded in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the reaſonableneſs of Religion, and intend at one time or other to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Religious; they hope they ſhall live to a good Old Age, and then grow weary of the World, and its Vices to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but can they think when they are fit for nothing elſe, they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do God good Service: So unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable are ſome Mens expectations, though they come in at the laſt hour, and are paſt their labor too, yet hope to ſtand upon the ſame Terms with thoſe that have born the heat of the day, and think God a hard Maſter, if he ſhould diſcount for their Idleneſs. Though they can't complain with the Servant in the Goſpel, that God reaps where he does not ſow, for they tacitly confeſs 'tis in their own power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180424:18"/>their Talent, but are unwilling God ſhould have too much intereſt: They are ſenſible their time is given them to work out their Salvation, but ſuppoſe a ſmall part will ſuffice for that, therefore reſerve it for the laſt thing, that at leaſt they may conclude well; but if the night ſhould come on before they have finiſhed, they muſt not be angry at that diſmal ſurpriſe; they knew their Maſter's will, and muſt ſubmit to be puniſh'd for their neglect with weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</p>
            <p>We all have an inclination to be Happy, and accordingly perſue what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we think leads to Satisfaction; the only Unhappineſs is, we are apt to be miſtaken, and place our Felicity in things which profit nothing; we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally adhere to a ſenſible good, fancy that Religion ties us up from thoſe Delights, and therefore deſire to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and left to our own Enjoyments. There is little hopes of Mens growing wiſer, till they are better reconciled to <hi>Religion;</hi> 'tis the Devil's ſubtilty to repreſent its Precepts impracticable, and in ſo looſe an Age, when Men give themſelves up to Eaſe and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Nothing appears ſo terrible as the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:180424:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>taking up the Croſs, but if Men could be perſwaded to ſuſpend their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till they become capable of giving judgment, we might hope to ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bear ſo great a Character, as the <hi>Beauties of Religion:</hi> We are required to deny our ſelves nothing that is fit for wiſe Men to do, and are generally ſo fond of that Epithet, its wonder we don't endeavour to deſerve it. None ſo really can lay claim to it, as they who have the fear of God before their Eyes; for <hi>the fear of the Lord, that is, Wiſdom, and to depart from Evil, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> They have the greateſt ſhare of Knowledge, whoſe converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in Heaven, and ſtudy in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt: There we learn thoſe wondrous Truths which puts Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy to a ſtand, and renders the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this World fooliſhneſs. There we may learn what God has done for us, and what we ought to do for our ſelves, could we be ſo happy as to be govern'd by our Reaſon, to let our thoughts have there proper place, we ſhould in a little time perceive that we were not ſent hither to gaze about us, that we have immortal Souls to be taken care of, that the greateſt Age is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180424:19"/>but a few days, and all the Pleaſures of this World momentary and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that if we all could rejoice in the days of our Youth, yet we muſt be brought to Judgment; could we but think of theſe things, we ſhould find enough to do, to ſecure our intereſt in Heaven, and may conveniently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with the Vanities of this World; for beſides the evil of them, they take us off of the contemplation of much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things. He that has God and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity upon his Mind, has infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety to employ his Thoughts. The moſt exquiſite Wits have ſubject for their Fancies, and the ignorant may be improving in true Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>'Tis our misfortune to ſuffer the love of this World to prevail upon us, and till we have ſomething more love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remove our Affections, can't eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give a Bill of Divorce. Our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are ſtrong, and when we have habituated our ſelves to the love of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one thing, can't quickly put a curb to our deſires; we talk of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but at a diſtance, think it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to take up with thoſe pleaſures, when we can enjoy theſe no longer we are ſure of the preſent, and have a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:180424:19"/>miſtruſt either that the future will not come, or that they are not worth the exchange, that we ſhould deny our ſelves a familliar ſatisfaction for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain expectations. 'Tis from ſuch reaſons we are deluded, and though we dare not ſpeak out, are ſuch fools as to miſtruſt in our hearts the truth of theſe things. In ſhort, 'tis the want of Faith, we are not fully convinced of the exiſtence of a Deity, or that there is a Providence in the World. This proceeds from the want of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, we dont allow our ſelves time to think, but take it upon truſt, we don't endeavour to reconcile it to our Reaſon, and having no conviction in our minds grow indifferent, at laſt come to that degree of wickedneſs as to caſt off all thoughts of God and Religion.</p>
            <p>This is certainly the Caſe of too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: And even among thoſe who are more fully perſuaded of theſe things; that believe there is a God, and a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, we find a prodigious Neglect; and have nothing but their Words, to incline us to believe they ever heard of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they come to Church once a a Week, hear <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> preach'd, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:180424:20"/>that they muſt depend upon his Merits to be ſaved. This they are willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if God will accept them upon that Condition; for they do not care to be concern'd in the <hi>Working out their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> but are free to let our <hi>Saviour</hi> have the Honour of Conducting them to <hi>Heaven,</hi> if they may be exempt from the Severity of <hi>Fear and Trembling:</hi> They can heartily believe any thing that favours their Intereſt, and are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſirous of getting into <hi>Paradiſe</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> if God will excufe them from <hi>Good Works.</hi> But this we muſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; for we are as certain as there is a God, that <hi>no unrighteous Man ſhall ſee his Face;</hi> nor any Man, without <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and a <hi>true Faith</hi> in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt. Except we repent, we ſhall all likewiſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh:</hi> And <hi>unleſs we believe that</hi> Jeſus <hi>is the</hi> Chriſt, <hi>ſhall be damned.</hi> True <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> is a hearty Sorrow for Sin paſt, and a ſerious Reſolution to amend our Lives for the future. <hi>True Faith will be ſhewn by our Works; for if we believe in him, we ſhall keep his Commandments.</hi> We cannot think that God made us for nothing; and was at the Expence of ſo great a Miracle, only to furniſh witty Men with Matter for a ſtrange Story.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:180424:20"/>There muſt be ſomething more in Sin, than we imagine; and the Provocations of the Wicked muſt be exceeding abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable. It muſt be of a prodigious Nature, that could ſo incenſe a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God, that nothing leſs than the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his Son could expiate. Can we think the <hi>Work of our Redemption</hi> of ſo little value, that it is not to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered? Oh! let the Conſideration of this move us to be grateful to the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Let us glorifie God in our Lives; and let not the <hi>Price of his Blood</hi> be utterly loſt: Let the Time paſt of our Lives ſuffice for the <hi>Works of Iniquity;</hi> and let us <hi>break off our Sins by Repentance, and turn to the Lord our God.</hi> To which End, let us call our ſelves to a ſevere Account, and examine the Errour of our Ways; let us humble our ſelves in Faſting and Prayer, beg Pardon for our Offences, and Strength to withſtand the Aſſaults of the Devil, and our Inclinations; for <hi>till we are thus purified, we expect the Grace of God in vain. Chriſt</hi> will not come into a filthy Habitation; and while our Bodies are unclean, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> will not erect his Temple there. How neceſſary is it then to begin our <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:180424:21"/>ſpeedily; <hi>to day, while it is called to day, leſt any of us be harden'd through the Deceitfulneſs of Sin?</hi> Sin is very bewitching; and when it has got the Maſtery, is not eaſily reſiſted. Habits require a great deal of Pains to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn; eſpecially, when they are ſuch as cauſe us not only to take pleaſure in them our ſelves, but delight in thoſe who do the ſame thing: They are then become mighty <hi>Dallila's,</hi> dearer to us than our Eyes or Limbs; we can much rather part with either than our Luſts: Of ſuch mighty force are they, that we not only looſe our Strength, but Reaſon; and are led Captives whereſoever they will. A Man thus overcome, is miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable indeed; for he is not only under the Power of the Devil, and his own unruly Luſts; but has God for his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: And where can he then flee for Succour? How dreadfully muſt his Soul be ſhaken, when his Conſcience begins to ſuggeſt all things are not well within, that there is a Neceſſity of a ſpeedy Alteration; that his Impieties are daring, and grown to ſuch a heighth as cannot be thought on without Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Confuſion; when he can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put off theſe Reflections, or bear
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:180424:21"/>the Trial of the Proſpect! The firſt Sight renders him monſtrous; and the Continuance, exceeding frightful! It caſts him into a thoughtleſs, yet ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Condition, and leaves him under the Preſſure of a wounded Spirit! Such are generally the Conflicts of thoſe that have ſubmitted to the Yoke of <hi>Satan,</hi> when they firſt come to themſelves: And no Man that believ'd the Torture of this Condition, would put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under ſo dreadful a Neceſſity. Alas! theſe are but the Beginning of Sorrows; there is <hi>Eternity</hi> behind, and <hi>Hell,</hi> the <hi>Habitation of the Wicked for ever,</hi> unleſs this Senſe of Sin drives us to <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Reformation.</hi> But 'tis uncertain whether we ſhall come thus to our ſelves, till <hi>Death</hi> overtake us; or, ſince we reſolv'd to ſin till we could ſin no longer, whether there will be Place found for our Tears. Therefore let every Man call his Ways to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: But they who are thus enſlav'd in Sin, let them make haſte to deliver themſelves from the <hi>Wrath to come;</hi> their Caſe is very dangerous, they ſeem to be deſtin'd to Deſtruction; for they have ſo long ſuffer'd their Luſts to have Dominion over them, that they know
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:180424:22"/>not how to free themſelves from this <hi>Tyranny of Sin.</hi> But bleſſed be God, who has provided <hi>a Lamb for the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> there is yet a Way for our <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption;</hi> God has not wholly left us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Help in this World. Though <hi>the Prayers of the Wicked are an Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> yet thoſe of the Penitent are not ſo. If we are ſo happy as to ſtop in this Career, have but ſo much Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to begin a <hi>Reformation,</hi> God is ſo merciful as to add his Grace to help us forward to <hi>Repentance:</hi> But 'tis only when God ſees us ſet about it in earneſt, for he knows our Hearts and Thoughts long before.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us embrace the firſt Thoughts of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and carry them on to a ſincere Reformation: Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from the World, and humble our ſelves in <hi>Faſting;</hi> and this not once or twice, but often; for we have need to <hi>cry mightily to God,</hi> Day and Night, to be <hi>redeem'd</hi> from this worſe than <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian Bondage.</hi> On the Day of our <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,</hi> that the Miſery of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition may oblige us to the greater <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence,</hi> let us firſt conſider the Odiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin, that we may learn to deteſt it; the Aggravation of it, by being
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:180424:22"/>committed frequently, preſumptuouſly, and againſt Knowledge; that we may abhor our ſelves for our <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</hi> Then let us reflect upon the Number of them; which being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, ought to lay us in the Duſt, and confeſs our ſelves to be worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

               <q>O moſt gracious God, who out of thy boundleſs Compaſſion to thy Creatures, art never wanting in any means that may draw them to thy ſelf. I the unworthieſt of thy Servants, deſire to give Glory to thee in a hearty acknowledgement, that thou haſt afforded me all the methods that might either force or allure me to Obedience; but I have reſiſted that goodneſs of thine which ſhould have lead me to Repentance: Thy compaſſion has been affronted by my continuance in ſin, and thy forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance only ſerv'd to harden me in Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. I have lived to provoke thy Mercies, by endeavouring to out-vye them with my Sins; what can I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect but to find a Judgment worthy of God, ſuch an irreverſible ruine as might render me an aſtoniſhing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of thy ſeverity to the whole Earth. Thou haſt atteſted thy ſelf to be indeed a Father of Mercies, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:180424:31"/>yet I who enjoy the benefit of them, neither conſider them as Bleſſings, nor thee as a God; but Atheiſtically defie that providence by which I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. (Thou giveſt me a time for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but I'm unwilling to throw off this Bondage of Sin, and think it a hardſhip to ſubmit to that Yoak whieh is eaſie and delightful, and if I cou'd ſtifle the Terrors of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, wou'd glady proclaim Licence to my Luſts. Theſe are the baſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns I have made; thus have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited the Lord, and incur'd his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, yet I am fearleſs of his Wrath, and can't repent me of my ways, nor conſider the Evil I have done. Surely my Heart is heardned; and I am nigh unto Curſing: O Lord, what can I plead to avert the ſentence, who am as far from Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence as Innocence? How can I pray againſt that Vengeance which I make it my buſineſs to pull down? if thou, O Lord, ſhou'dſt ſpare me, what wou'd it avail if it ſerve but to ſet me at a greater Hoſtillity with thee?

Oh! bow thy Heaven and come down, hear the Prayer of a diſtreſſed Sinner, deliver me from that miſery I have involved my ſelf, put thy Laws a new into my Heart, and write them in my Mind.

What can I ſay to thee, <hi>O thou preſerver, thou redeemer of men,</hi> who have put my ſelf beyond all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary means of thy grace: I can only lay my ſelf at thy Feet, diſplay my miſery, and leave thee to conſider thine own compaſſion. Oh, let that move thee to do for me, whatever my wretched ſtate is in need off. O Lord, Hear, O Lord, forgive, conſider, and do it, for thy name ſake: Thou art Jeſus, a Saviour, ſave thy ſervant from his ſin, and let me not ſlide back by a perpetual backſliding. Oh, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon not thy poor creature, Lord, careſt thou not that I periſh. Turn thee again, O Lord, ſanctifie and cleanſe me for I am exceeding ſinfull, create a new Spirit within me, melt my obdurate heart into contrition, and if it cannot be done without the rigour of thy Laws, Lord do that, or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:180424:33"/>any thing with me, ſo that I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Veſſel of honour meet for thy Service.

               <p>When we come abroad into the World, there is a neceſſity we ſet a watch over ourſelves, we muſt expect to be attack'd, if we can bear the firſt aſſault, the reſt will fall by degrees, and every <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be leſs powerful; when we are firſt tempted let us remember, that this is the very thing that has coſt us ſo much trouble, which we vow'd to reſiſt, which is our mortal Enemy, and which will ſet us at a greater variance with God. How can we do this thing, and ſin againſt Heaven? Let us Remember this is the firſt Tryal, if we ſubmit, how can we think to prevail another time? the next <hi>Temptation</hi> may have a better appearance. There may be a Thouſand things to render it more ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and ſo by degrees we ſhall be brought to our old ſtate, and the laſt condition will be worſe than the firſt. We muſt not allow our ſelves in the Commiſſion of any one known ſin, we muſt reſiſt the beginning, we muſt not ſuffer our ſelves to think upon old Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, but with abhorrence; for 'tis not only a ſin, but will endanger us to fall back. If we take pleaſure in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, the Devil wont fail to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our delight, by adding ſome new
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:180424:42"/>reliſh to make them more acceptable; if we would ſhun the danger, we muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the occaſion, and then need not fear being led into <hi>Temptation.</hi> But there is a greater motive yet; we muſt remember we are but beginning, and to look back at the firſt ſtep is ſuch a piece of folly, that every body muſt be aſhamed of. Sure none can be ſo unreaſonable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it ſhould be reckoned among their good Deeds, that they only thought of <hi>Repentance;</hi> if we are truly ſenſible of our ſins, we ſhall be very deſirous to get rid of them: We are taught there is no way, but by coming to Chriſt, <hi>they that come unto him muſt do the Will of his Father,</hi> to thoſe he gives power to become the Sons of God, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are manifeſt; they that do wickedneſs are not of God. Let us endeavour therefore to add to our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> Obedience, that acceptable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and be forward in all the duties of Chriſtianity; that ſo we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our ſelves in well doing, for 'tis the will of the Lord that we add to our Faith, Vertue; and when we have tryed our ſelves, that we can reſiſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are ready to Good Works; let us then prepare to meet the Lord at
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:180424:42"/>his Holy Table, that we may receive Grace and Strength, <hi>to walk in the ſame all the days of our lives.</hi> This is the great duty of the <hi>New Law,</hi> and there needs no arguments to bring thoſe to the Sacrifice, who are ſenſible of their neceſſities, or are deſirous of growing better. Our Church has taken care to inſtruct every Chriſtian how he may become a worthy Receiver, by telling him firſt what he ought to Believe and then what he ought to Practice. I ſhall content my ſelf with the method of the Church in both theſe Caſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to thoſe who are deſirous to be inform'd. Bread and Wine is what the Lord has commanded to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and the Church has told us, that they ſignifie the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which are verily and indeed taken by the Faithful, and the benefits are the ſtrengthning and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Souls. This is what we are poſitively to believe, and when we can give our intire aſſent, let us according to the Direction of the Church examine our ſelves, whether we repent truly of our former ſins, <hi>ſteadfaſtly purpoſing to lead a new Life, have a lively Faith in God's mercy through Jeſus Chriſt, with a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:180424:43"/>thankful Remembrance of his Death, and be in Charity with all Men.</hi> This is in ſhort the Duty of every <hi>Communicant,</hi> and no Man who would come to the Lord's Supper worthily, can leave out any of theſe things; inſtead of a great many Arguments, I muſt preſs the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of them. 'Tis the misfortune of a great many to think they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their Duty, if they can uſe ſo much Self-denial as to refrain from their uſual exceſs a week before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſay the Morning and Evening Devotion, and bring themſelves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they are ſorry, for what upon a little Examination, they find a miſs. This they think is <hi>Repentance</hi> enough, and becauſe their Book finds no more work for them, ſet down well ſatisfied with their performance. They ſeem willing to compound the matter with God Almighty, confeſs themſelves Bank-rupt, and deſire to be ſet free for paying half Tribute. They have their ſet times for <hi>Devotion,</hi> are content to be Fools for three Weeks, and then ſet down to make up the Month the other week, and confeſs their Folly: Thus for one weeks <hi>Pennance</hi> think God is obliged to be reconciled, and becauſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:180424:43"/>they have the impudence to wipe their Mouth, conclude God will think they have done no ill; but we can't deceive God, where 'tis to be had, he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the uttermoſt Farthing; <hi>let our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences be our Judges, and our Guides:</hi> Uſe Books only as helps to <hi>Devotion,</hi> for 'tis impoſſible for a Book to be writ to ſuit every Man's occaſion, there is ſomething particular to every one of us, that another perhaps never thought of, and 'tis not likely ſuch a one is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to preſcribe a Remedy before hand; wherefore when we are arrived ſo far in our way to <hi>Happineſs,</hi> as the forſaking our old Habits, and placing better in their room, we may venture to draw nigh to that <hi>Holy Ordinance,</hi> of which whoſoever is a worthy partaker ſhall live for ever. A good Life is the beſt preparitive to this Feaſt, 'tis not enough we ſhake hands with our Vices for a time, and return to our Folly when the Ceremony is over; if we are not qualified before we come, we are in danger to receive this <hi>Sacrament Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily,</hi> and the conſequence of that is ſo terrible, that the thoughts of it muſt amaze us: No Man is qualified that does not ſincerely <hi>Repent,</hi> it can't be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:180424:44"/>ſuppoſed that God has allotted juſt ſo much time to mortifie ourſelves, or that a week is ſufficient to prepare us for <hi>Heaven.</hi> They who have lived in a courſe of ſin, and never approached this <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> muſt not think the firſt fit of Sorrow ſufficient to Denounce them true <hi>Penitents.</hi> It requires time, and pains to conquer their <hi>Luſts,</hi> the old Man muſt be caſt off, and they muſt give a ſignal of their Loyalty before they be accepted Subjects of the <hi>Moſt High;</hi> in ſhort, if upon Examination we find our Faith firm, our Purpoſes ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and our Deſires after Chriſt ſtrong, we may come to the Altar of God, and if we appear there with Charity; our Prayers ſhall be convey'd from thence to the preſence of God. 'Tis upon no other terms we can come with ſecurity, for there is no concord between Chriſt and <hi>Beliai:</hi> They who frequent the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and ſuffer themſelves in the Commiſſion of any known ſin, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling of contradictions, and will find their miſtake to their confuſion.</p>
               <p>'Tis very certain, as long as we are upon Earth, we are in a ſtate of Trial; no man muſt expect to be exempt from Temptation: But we ſhould make it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:180424:44"/>our buſineſs to ſtrive and reſiſt the <hi>World, Fleſh</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi> If by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, or other accident, we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into ſin, we know our duty to be ſorry, and arm our ſelves againſt it for the future: We may reaſonably expect pardon upon this humiliation, if we dont join our good Will, and commit the evil with approbation. This we certainly do, if we ſuffer our ſelves to be often over come by the ſame Temptation; ſuch a one ought to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſincerity of his reſolution, and not approach the holy communion, till he is ſatisfied his heart is perfect in the Commandments of God: But after all, men muſt be left to themſelves in this matter: 'Tis certain, no man can be a Hipocrite againſt his knowledge, and what pretences men have for Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy in other caſes, they are reaſons of a prodigious nature, which ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a man to play the cheat upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: For no man is forced to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and if he was, 'tis very ſad it ſhould be accounted criminal to Oblige them to be good: However men trifle in other caſes, let them be ſerious in this; if they are really ſincere, God will pardon a multitude of Faults; no
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:180424:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>Man that knows his own ſincerity need be affraid to approach the table of the Lord.</p>
               <p>When the Miniſter declares the time of the next Communion, and invites all ſuch as ſhall religiouſly be diſpoſed, let us lift up our Souls to God, and beg of him that we may become wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Partakers of his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood:</hi> In order to it, let us remember, the nearer we draw to God in his <hi>Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> the greater muſt be our care in the Management of our ſelves; tho', (as I have already premiſed) a <hi>Good Life</hi> is the beſt preparative to a worthy Reception of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> yet when we approach the Preſence of the Lord, we ought to be more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary circumſpect. 'Twas <hi>David's</hi> reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, <hi>To waſh his hands in Innocency,</hi> before he approacht the Altar of God. God himſelf commanded <hi>Joſhua</hi> to pull off his ſhooes when he was upon the holy Ground; and then ſurely 'tis our duty, to become ſuch as the Lord may be we well pleaſed with: Let us as much as poſſible this week, have our converſation with God: Don't let it ſuffice that we have formerly call'd our ſelves to account, but go over all again,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:180424:45"/>there may be ſomething paſt over in our laſt <hi>Examination,</hi> or ſomething new to add to our <hi>Affliction;</hi> however the ſight of our late <hi>Iniquity</hi> will ſufficiently affect us, and beholding our miſery afreſh, we ſhall be the more deſirous of coming to Chriſt; for our Sins when we are ſenſible of them, will be a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then too heavy for us to bear: But to increaſe our <hi>Deſires, Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> let us reflect on the Goodneſs of God, in ſending Our Saviour Jeſus to be a ſacrifice for our Sins, that as the Terrors of the Lord firſt brought us to our ſelves, ſo now the <hi>Wonders</hi> of his Love may effectually perſwade us to turn to the Lord our God, that he may have mercy upon us.</p>

               <p>O Thou Word of God, how didſt thou ſtrip thy ſelf of thy <hi>Glory,</hi> and deſcend from the felicities of thy <hi>Throne,</hi> to take upon thee the form of a Servant?

               <p>He had no ſooner overcome this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Conflict, but behold the fatal Meſſengers of his Afflictions ready to apprehend him; his own familliar Friend, who had eat of his Bread, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting them to the place where he was. This was their hour, and he was to ſuffer even for the ingratitude of his Murderers; he finds himſelf now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, as well as betrayed by his Friends, and they who could not watch for his ſafety, could now fly for their

Where, though their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice was great enough to ſay any thing, cou'd not make their accuſations agree; they laid to his Charge things that he never <hi>ſaid nor did,</hi> yet that with the Voices of the chief <hi>Prieſts</hi> muſt prevail; and though the judge declared him Guiltleſs, yet the People had among them a Law, by which he ought to die: Even to this, he opened not his <hi>Mouth,</hi> but ſubmitted to all that their <hi>Revenge, Impudence</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> cou'd invent. Since he had profeſt himſelf their King, they were reſolved not to lead him to <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> before they Cloathed him with

What an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Mercy is it that we are not this minute in thoſe unquenchable Flames, where the exquiſitneſs of the Torment ſhould oblige us inſtead of crying for Mercy to breath out horrid Blaſphemies? And as we ſlighted his Government here, Curſe and Dam his ſeverity thee, ſtill ſinking our ſelves deeper in the intollerable Miſery, where will be no Mittigation of the <hi>Torment,</hi> nor end to our ſad <hi>Affliction.</hi> Let us conſtrain all the forces of our <hi>Soul</hi> to praiſe God that we are alive, entreating his Pardon: Let us beg Pardon even for taking that liberty to praiſe him, and withal, that he would ſtill help us
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:180424:51"/>to praiſe him more. O let us reflect on every thing that may move us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> and be ſorry for our ſins.</p>
               <p>The thoughts of theſe things may well enough put us in a heat, and when our Paſſions are throughly urged, vent themſelves in Sighs, and earneſt deſires of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> that both of them may meet with ſucceſs; let us add alms to our <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> for when our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions are thus aſſiſted, the mercy of God will not deny us a ſuitable return; therefore in the entrance to our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let us ſet apart ſomething for the Poor, and humbly offer it up in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing form.</p>

               <p>Having performed theſe Devotions faithfully, let us wait for the Bleſſing of the Lord; if we would have a ſpeedy anſwer to our <hi>Prayers,</hi> let us have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in all our Converſation to what we have been doing. 'Tis not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that we paſſionately beg God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, we muſt endeavour to deſerve it by performing his will, and when God ſees that we chooſe him, he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny us the Bleſſings that are needful for us. 'Tis not to be ſuppoſed, that Man is ſerious who can be earneſt and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in his Cloſeſt, but looſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate in the World, or that he is heartily deſirous to be eaſed of his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who makes no other attempts to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:180424:60"/>acquit himſelf, but when he is upon his Knees. Can we think God will hear the Prayer of a Man who only asks to be freed from his Infirmities? <hi>When the wicked Man turns from his Wickedneſs, and does that which is Lawful and Right, be ſhall ſave his Soul, and not before.</hi> If a Man that is an <hi>Adulterer, Laſcivious</hi> or <hi>Unclean,</hi> would have his <hi>Vices</hi> rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, he muſt firſt ſet himſelf againſt the <hi>Sin,</hi> endeavour to mortifie the <hi>Luſt,</hi> and avoid the occaſion of his Folly, and then he may expect God's Pardon for the paſt, and aſſiſtance for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: He ought during the time of his Tryal to beg God's Grace to help him in the conqueſt of this <hi>Enemy,</hi> and if he is ſincere, may be ſure in a little time, that he will be more than Conqueror; but don't let us fly to God to ſave us from thoſe <hi>Evils</hi> we voluntary run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, which we don't care to avoid, and which are no longer uneaſie than they ſenſibly affect us. We ſhall but mock God, and provoke him to give us up to the deceits of our own Heart; but 'tis hoped they who are arrived ſo far in <hi>Vertue,</hi> as to ſet their Reſolutions to approach the <hi>Altar of God,</hi> have no ſuch cuſtom that they truly are ſorry for
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:180424:60"/>their <hi>Offences,</hi> and intend to lead a new life, that their Faith is ſuch as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the World, that they have brought under their unruly Appetites, and are zealous of <hi>good Works.</hi> Theſe are the things about which we ought to Examine our ſelves, let this be our ſtudy, the nearer we approach this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity that ſo we may ſearch every Corner of our Hearts, and when we have ſet our ways before our Eyes, there is no doubt but we ſhall bewail the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of them, and raiſe in our Souls an ardent love to Chriſt who is ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to relieve us, and has done ſo much to bring us into Favour with God. Our <hi>unworthineſs</hi> and his Mercy are ſufficient to exerciſe our thoughts our whole lives, we are aſtoniſhed at the one, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at the other; but when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his mercy extends to the other World, even to the making us happy for ever, we know not what to ſay are deſirous, our Eternity ſhould be paſſed away in his Praiſes, and even wiſh for the order of a Seraphim to expreſs our grateful acknowledgments in <hi>Joyful Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujahs;</hi> they who conſider the dignity of this Sacrament, will be deſirous of approaching thither with all poſſible
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:180424:61"/>purity, and endeavour to cleanſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves according to the Purification of the Sanctuary. In ſhort, let us but get a true underſtanding of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that will teach us our Duty.</p>

               <p>O What ſhall I do to have my Soul wholly poſſeſt with thee, but by coming to thy <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> there to ſeal the promiſes I have made to thee this Week, for the future to live more Godly? Suffer me (thy ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice laid aſide) to ſpeak unto thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, me Duſt and Aſhes, yet ſuffer me to ſpeak, being 'tis to the mercies of God; ſay unto my Soul, <hi>I am thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and hide not thy face from me,</hi> let me ſee it, though I die, leaſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I die, ſo as never to ſee it; the manſion of my Soul is to marrow to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain thee. O let it be enlarged by thee, by my coming to thy Table, it is very ruinous, be thou pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair it; cleanſe me, O Lord, from my ſecret ſins, from my preſumptuous
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:180424:61"/>wickedneſs deliver thy Servant. I have confeſſed theſe my ſins unto thee, and hope thou haſt forgiven the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them. I do not contend in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with thee, for thou art the Truth: If thou, Lord, ſhouldſt mark iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who may abide? But we have confidence in thy mercy through the merits of our Saviour and Mediator, who was alſo made known to the Saints of Old, that they by the Faith of his <hi>Paſſion</hi> to come, as we by the Faith of it paſt, might obtain Salvation. As he was <hi>Man,</hi> he was <hi>Mediator,</hi> but as he was the <hi>Word,</hi> ſo he was no midling Perſon, becauſe equal to God, and God with God, together with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, one God. How far haſt thou loved us, O thou good Father, who ſparedſt not thine only Son, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up for us ungodly? How far haſt thou loved us, for whom he who thought it no Robery to be equal to thee, was made ſubject even to Death upon the Croſs? Therefore do I juſtly repoſe ſtrong hope in thee, that thou wilt heal all my Diſeaſes which are very great, but much greater is the cure which thou haſt provided. This is my great delight, and ſo often as I can be
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:180424:62"/>releaſed from neceſſary affairs, I will repair to this pleaſure of coming to thy <hi>Table,</hi> neither find I in all theſe things which I run through any ſettlement for my Soul, ſave only in thee. Behold, <hi>O Lord,</hi> I caſt all my care upon thee, let me live, and I will conſider the wonderful things of thy Law; thou knoweſt my <hi>Ignorance,</hi> my <hi>Infirmities,</hi> teach me, heal me, O Jeſus, in whom are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom. Redeem me with thine own <hi>Blood,</hi> for I meditate on it; I Eat and Drink at thy Table, and deſire to be ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, amongſt thoſe who Eat, and are ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Oh! Lord, thou ſeeſt how much I have left behind after all my dilligence to cleanſe and purifie my <hi>Soul.</hi> Alas! all my thoughts of thee are but <hi>Dreams,</hi> my Deſires but a <hi>Vapour,</hi> my love but a <hi>Flaſh,</hi> my Prayers are but a <hi>Breath,</hi> and my Tears will ſcarce fill a <hi>Buble;</hi> my Sorrow is no bigger than a <hi>Sigh,</hi> all that I do, I am aſhamed of it my ſelf, and thou mayeſt much more loath and diſpiſe it. Come thou, O Lord, therefore and ſearch my <hi>heart,</hi> try <hi>me,</hi> and know my <hi>toughts,</hi> ſee if there be any way of <hi>wickedneſs</hi> in <hi>me,</hi> and lead
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:180424:62"/>
                  <hi>me</hi> in the way Everlaſting. Do thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken in me moſt lively thoughts, do thou inkindle a burning affection, open thou the Flood-gates of my Eyes, and open thou my Lips that my Mouth may ſhew forth thy praiſe. O my gracious God, unleſs thou interpoſe thy power, I am very much affraid I ſhall not keep this little goodneſs till the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which now ſeems to be in me. Theſe weak Thoughts, theſe faint De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and ſickly Affections that are in my Soul, I doubt will not live a Night, unleſs thou find ways to preſerve and cheriſh them; my inveterate Habits of Evil will ſmother and choak theſe new Reſolutions, I am in fear that all theſe Meditations will be flown away, while I am a ſleep, and my Houſe be foul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, unleſs thou keep me. Ah! my dear God, ſeeing I have beſtowed ſome ſmall pains upon my heart, and have conceived ſome little hopes, ſuffer them not to be daſh'd to pieces in a Night, ſpread the Wings of thy goodneſs over me, and maintain that, which not I, but thou thy ſelf haſt wrought. Lord, let me find when I awake, that my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections and deſires are grown beyond the ſtrength of Man, and that thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:180424:63"/>reſt upon me. Oh! let me find a greater fervor than ever in thy Service, let that ſpark which I fear would go out, be blown into a Flame that will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expire; ſo ſhalt thou draw mine Eyes towards thy ſelf alone, who work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſuch wonders, and my Lips ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver flow with thy Praiſes. Lord, if I may beg this <hi>Grace</hi> of thee, I am veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded I ſhall languiſh after none but thee; therefore my good Lord, I leave my ſelf in thy hands, hoping that either I am, or would be, ſuch as thou deſireſt, and if I am arrived but as far as a Will and Deſire to be thine, that Will is thine, and therefore ſeeing the Will is mine too, and we both conſpire together, I take the boldneſs to ſay, <hi>Lord, let thy will be done.</hi> Oh! ſweet Saviour, I was going to ſay, I am ſick of Love, that I cannot love except thou love me, and make me better, but I cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect my ſelf, and 'tis enough if I be ſick, becauſe I cannot love thee. Do thou make me ſick, or rather do thou make me well with love unto thee, ſo ſhall I come to thy Table with Joy and Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hoping that thou wilt kiſs me with the Benediction of thy Lips, for thy love is better than Wine; draw me, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:180424:63"/>I will run after thee, yea, we will run after thee, for I will proclaim to others the loving kindneſs of the Lord, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>

                  <hi>O</hi> Lord, I do not preſume to come to that great Feaſt of thy Body and Blood, upon the leaſt opinion of my own worthineſs; for when I look upon my ſelf, I dare not come leaſt I ſhould Eat and Drink my own Damnation; but when I conſider thy infinite Mercies unto us, and thy own words calling all men without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and knowing that thy crucified Body is not only food to nouriſh, but Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to cure: I beg leave that am but Duſt and Aſhes to come to thy Holy Table, and with my weak Faith, to feed upon ſome Crumbs of the Bread of Life. I confeſs, O Lord, I have no Wedding Garments on me, but I come to ſeek them at thy Croſs, from thy bitter ſorrows to derive into my Soul a Godly ſorrow working an unfeigned Repentance, from the broken Body, a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:180424:69"/>which he was in little time to graple with; they ſhook his very Nature, melted him into ſtreams of Blood, and ſo caſt down his Spirits, that nothing leſs than an Angel of the preſence, was able to mittigate the conflicts of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe inſupportable Agony. Theſe are but the beginning of Sorrows, for no ſooner then Mercy overcame the afflicting convulſion of his Soul, who was ſorrowful to Death, but he began to fortifie his kind intentions to poor Man, by that inexpreſſibly loving, and unparallel'd Reſignation to the will of his Heavenly Father, he chearfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to offer up that Sacrifice which was to appeaſe the Divine Juſtice for the iniquities of an impious World; when after a moſt exemplary ſubmiſſion to the affronts and injuries of implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirits, the ingrateful Malice, and ſupercillious Envy of thoſe who thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Blood, being deſpitefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, afflicted and tormented, denied by ſome, forſaken by others, deſolate and comfortleſs in every ſenſe, truly a Man of ſorrows was forced to add weight to his paſt Sufferings, and bear the Croſs of his own Crucifixion.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:180424:69"/>
               <p>Where, O my Soul, behold by Faith the Lamb of God lifted up for the ſins of the World. O humble thy ſelf into the center of thy own nothing, for of what puniſhment oughteſt thou to be thought worthy, that haſt ſo inſenſed the Majeſty of Heaven, to give up the innocent and moſt Holy Jeſus, thy beſt, thy only Friend, and his dear Son to be Tortured and Tormented for thy ſins. O how cruelly was he ſcourged with Wips, wounded with Thorns, loaden with the Croſs, torn with Nails, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with a Spear, and racked on the moſt painful inſtrument of Death, his lovely Face defiled with Blood and Spitting, his Ears fill'd with Upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Curſes, his Eyes drenched in Tears for the ruine of his Enemies, and his Soul amazed at the Terrors of an angry God; 'till at length all wounded, broken and bloody with many groans, yet with admirable patience he breaths out his Soul with infinite Charity and Forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>O holy Jeſu! how excellent is thy Goodneſs? O ye bleſſed Hoſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who rejoice at the converſion of a ſinner, adore and praiſe that unknown ſorrow, which ye your ſelves contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate with awful admiration.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:180424:70"/>
               <p>I cannot doubt thy power to eaſe me, becauſe of theſe Suffrings of thy Love; I muſt not queſtion thy willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who calleſt me of thy own accord, nor dare I ſuſpect thy ſincerity, who art Truth it ſelf, and always in earneſt with poor ſinners; my Guilt has made me think to fly from thee, but thy mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Voice has eneouraged me to turn to thee, and laid me proſtrate at thy feet, groaning under my Offences; but if thou wilt pitty me, I am ſafe; it thou art pleaſed, I am eaſed; if thou pardon me, my burden is gone; and if thou wilt take away this intollerable Lord, I will then venture to draw nearer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to thy Altar, O holy Jeſu, there to receive more refreſhment from thy mercy. <hi>Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy leaden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Theſe are thy words, <hi>O Chriſt,</hi> for you haſt ſpoken them, and they are mine, becauſe ſpoken for my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. O ſweet and amiable words in the ear of a poor ſinner, by which thou inviteſt an indigent, ſtarv'd wretch to pertake of thy Body: But who am I, O Lord, that I ſhould come? The Angels and Archangels reverence thee, thy Saints and holy Ones fear before
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:180424:70"/>thee, and yet thou ſayeſt unto me, come: Unleſs thou haſt ſaid it, who could have believed it to be true? Unleſs thou hadſt commanded it, who durſt have attempted this approach?</p>
               <p>Does my Saviour invite? and ſhall I go? Shall a ſinner dare to ſit down at his Table? Does he invite, and ſhall I not go? Shall a Wretch preſume to refuſe his Call? Riſe then, my Soul, and take thy ſwifteſt wings, and fly to the preſence of this great Myſtery.</p>
               <p>A Feaſt of Holy Bread and Holy Wine, in repreſentation of thy ſacred Body and blood, where thy all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſelf is freely to the meaneſt gueſt a feaſt of peace and love, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable ſweetneſs, to which thy own bleſt mouth thus kindly calleſt us.</p>
               <p>But ſtay, am I dreſſed like a friend of the Bridegroom, that I ſafely may come to the Marriage Supper; have I conſidered how chaſt thoſe eyes ſhould be which go to behold the God of purity; have I conſidered how clean that mouth ſhould be, which preſumes to eat that Bread of Heaven, but moſt, how all caeleſtial that Soul ſhould be which aſpires to a union with the Body of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Oh! how poor, and dull, and empty am I, how infinitly unworthy of ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine a Sacrament; yet am I call'd by him that can Command, by him that ſees and pitties my miſery; he bids me come, he ſurely will receive me, and with his bounteous fullneſs ſupply my defects.</p>
               <p>Go then, my Soul, to that ſacred Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and take thy part of that delicious banquet; go all inflamed with Love and joy, and hope, and quench thy holy Thirſt with that ſpring of bliſs, when thou haſt taſted his everlaſting ſweetneſs, and feeleſt his heavenly ſtreams flow gently on thee; open thy happy breaſt, and ſuck thoſe Waters in, and let them freely run over all thy powers.</p>
               <p>Let them ſoak deep to the root of thy heart, and turn thy barren heath into a fruitful ſoil; fruitful in holy thoughts, and pious words; fruitful in good, juſt and charitable Deeds, fruitful in good examples; and God of his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs confirm all this, that my Soul may bleſs his holy Name here, and with the whole hoſt of Heaven ſing <hi>Hallelujah</hi> to him that ſits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for over hereafter, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>

               <p>The Bleſſings to be obtained, and the ſenſe of our Unworthineſs, which ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by this time is ingrafted in our hearts, will inform us, that each mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this day ought to be carefully employed, and therefore in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval when we can't be upon our knees, let our holy Meditations carry us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the contemplations of this world; and as this is a day of rejoicing, in which our Souls are to be ſolaced with the raviſhing ſweet of ſo divine a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, let our Actions atteſt this inward ſatisfaction, and ſhew in ſome ſort by their humble demeanor, that they are touched with a ſenſe of thoſe incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable delights, and can relinquiſh their ſenſual Enjoyments to attend the Devotions of their better part. After we have thus diſcharged our Duties in private, let us prepare for our more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Devotions in the Houſe of God. In our way thither, let us endeavour

               <p>O <hi>Moſt gracious and merciful Lord, thou haſt call'd all thoſe that are weary and heavy laden with the burthen of their ſins to come to thee, and haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to eaſe and refreſh them; thou haſt invited all thoſe that hunger and thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Righteouſneſs to come to thy Table and taſt of thy Supper, and has promiſed that thou wilt ſatisfie them in aſſurance of theſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:180424:72"/>promiſes; I come to the Lord Jeſus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching thee to eaſe and refreſh me, and to ſatisfie me with thy Mercy, for I hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after thee, and thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I confeſs that my daily ſins have made me unworthy of my daily Bread, much more of this heavenly Banquet. O make my Soul aſcend to thee in an humble ſupplication, and let my Saviour's interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion procure thine acceptance, and give me ſuch a faith as may take poſſeſſion of all I pray for; beſprinkle my polluted Soul in the Blood of thy dear Son Jeſus, O let the Blood of his Wounds, and the Water of his Side make me clean, that I may come to the bleſſed Feaſt of the ſpotleſs Lamb. I confeſs, O God, that when I conſider thy greatneſs, and my nothing, thy purity and my uncleanneſs, I ſee it infinitly unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and preſumptious in me to approach thy ſacred preſcence, and deſire to pertake of thy Sacrament, or hope for a part of thy Glory; but when I conſider thy Mercy and thy Wiſdom, thy Bounty and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thy readineſs to forgive, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to impart thy ſelf unto thy ſervants, then am I lifted up with hopes, then I come with boldneſs to the Throne of Grace, even ſo, O Lord, becauſe thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and loveſt it ſhould be ſo. It was
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:180424:73"/>never heard from the beginning of the World, that thou ever didſt diſpiſe him that call'd upon thee, or forſake any that did abide in thy fear, or that any that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in thee was ever confounded; but if I come to thee, I bring an unworthy perſon to be joyned to thee; and if I come not, I ſhall remain unworthy for ever; if I ſtay away, I fear to loſe thee; if I come, I fear to offend thee, and that will loſe thee more: I know, O God, my ſins have ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated between me and thee, but thy love, O Jeſus, and thy Paſſion, Holineſs and Obedience has reconciled us, and though my ſins deter me, they make it neceſſary I ſhould come, and though thy Greatneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazes, yet it is ſo full of goodneſs, that it invites and incourages me to approach theſe holy Myſteries this day. O mighty God, rebuke</hi> Satan, <hi>reſtrain all Earthly and Carnal affections, that they do not once dare to whiſper a temptation to my Soul, a diſtraction to my Thoughts, while I am in Communion with thee at thy Holy Altar; do thou, O Lord, rule me by thy Grace, govern me by thy Spirit, and defend me by thy Power, and crown me with thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which I humbly beg in the Name and Merits of my Redeemer Jeſus, whom with thee, O Father, and the Holy Spirit,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:180424:73"/>I will Worſhip as one God to all Eternity,</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>Let us now employ our Thoughts as becoming the Sons of God, and all the vacant time before the ſervice of the Church, let us employ in holy Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Let us remember not only that we are in his preſence, but that this is his day, on which we are met to glorifie his Name; for the good things we have received, to ask ſuch things as are neceſſary for our future well-fare, and to hear his Holy Word, to direct us in the way to Salvation. Let us beg of him to open our Hearts, that we may receive with meekneſs the word we are to hear; that for the Merits of Jeſus he will receive our Prayers, and no doubt when God ſees us earneſtly and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly challenging his Word, he will for his Truth and promiſe ſake grant us all thoſe good things which he knows need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us; and this ſhould mightily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to be ſincere at all times when we enter the place where his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour dwells. Certainly every Chriſtian that is ſenſible of the greatneſs of God, won't dare to diſſemble or behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf irreverently there, eſpecially at ſuch
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:180424:74"/>a time when our ſtrickeſt attention is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and even that not enough, to contemplate the moſt High.</p>
               <p>When the Service begins, we are to lay aſide theſe Meditations, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately apply our ſelves to that, if we devoutly attend to every part, ſhall need no Paraphraſe to heighten thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or make us more in love with that incomparable compoſure; 'tis the ſingular excellence of the Common Prayer, that they who frequent it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways find out ſomething that deſerves to be more admired than they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. I dare affirm no one ever found any flatneſs or defect that came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice, or was piouſly inclined, for it contains all that may occaſion a ſenſible pleaſure to a good Man. The Sentences and Exhortations are excellent motives to preſs us to our Duty; the confeſſion full of Pathetical expreſſions, and ſuted to the conditions of all men; the Abſolution moſt comfortable to a penitent Soul that wants to be eaſed from its weary Burthen. The Hymns, and Pſalms very proper to ſtir up our Souls to a holy rejoycing in the Lord; the Scripture has its place that we may receive comfort from thoſe lively Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:180424:74"/>of Truth. After the profeſſion of our Faith, we ſupplicate our God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle, not only for our ſelves, but for thoſe who are in authority over us, nay, our Charity reaches further, to all Chriſtian Kings and Princes; and to ſhew we are not forgetful of thoſe of leſſer degree, we extend it to all ſorts and conditions of men; What can be more agreeable to a devout Soul, than thus to exerciſe it ſelf in the Law of God? What can be more moving than to ſee, and hear a devout Prieſt offering up Prayers and Supplications, and others joining in his Petitions by Ecchoing a hearty <hi>Amen?</hi> How does it conſtrain us to out-vie in Zeal, and cauſe a Holy Emulation, when we hear our Miniſter with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, crying to the Father of Heaven to have Mercy upon us, and we with equal earneſtleſs invocating the Son and Holy Ghoſt mercifully to hear us? Let others mock, and call them vain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, while we endeavour to expreſs the deſires of our Souls in thoſe Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſupplications, <hi>Lord have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us,</hi> We are not ſo vain but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our want of that Mercy, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of the Repetition when we find
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:180424:75"/>the benefit, even the favour of the Lord, which is better than life it ſelf; wherefore I muſt be earneſt with every Chriſtian to attend this ſervice; don't let our thoughts be roving, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the wandrings of our minds, the whole Service is in order to prepare us to a worthy reception of the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; when once we have got the maſtry of our ſelves, and can go along with all the parts of the Church, we ſhall have leſs occaſions for theſe helps to Devotion; we ſhall find ſo much contained in the Prayers and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as will take up all the vacant time in Holy Meditation; and this will make Holineſs become exceeding delightful, when we can turn our Souls towards God, and ſolace them without interruption; when we can leave the thoughts of this World, and look ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly to God. But this is to be done by degrees, when we have conquer'd the love of this World, and wearied our ſelves from its Alurements, and this only to be performed by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant watch over our words and actions, and perſeverance in the ways of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:180424:75"/>
               <p>When the Prayers of the Church are over, let us humbly ask God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our defects in his Service, and ſay,</p>

               <p>Having diſcharged our duty in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God, let us prepare our ſelves to hear what he will ſay to us out of his Holy Word; we ought to look upon the Miniſter as an Ambaſſador of Chriſt, and hearken with reverence to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine at the end of it, to beg that we may bring forth the Fruit of it in our Lives and Converſation, and this we can't do in better words, than in one of the Collects after the Communion.</p>

               <p>When the Miniſter goes up to the Holy Table, letus raiſe our Affections, and prepare our ſelves to accompany him in this great work, and fixing our ſelves in a devout poſture when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the Exhortation to Charity, let our thoughts carry us beyond the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Expreſſion of thoſe Sentences; and whilſt he Reads, conſider the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the Poor. Let us enlarge our deſires, and wiſh we were able to ſatisfie the complaints of thoſe who are in want, at leaſt let us reſolve to do according as God has put it in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not Grudgingly, and of neceſſity, becauſe 'tis the cuſtom, and the Church requires it at ſuch Seaſons. Here we
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:180424:77"/>have an opportunity of examining our ſelves whether we have fulfill'd the will of God in this manner. 'Tis not to be ſuppoſed that we deſerve the name of charitable perſons, who take no time to diſtribute of this World good, but when we can't help it; therefore let us ask our Souls at every Sentence, Haſt thou followed this Advice, or obeyed this Command? Haſt thou performed that great duty of the Law, doing as thou wouldſt be done by? Haſt thou reſtored with intereſt, whatever thou haſt unjuſtly detained from any Man? And firſt, have we taken care that they who have ſown unto us Spiritual things, ſhould reap of our Temporal; for 'tis meet, thoſe who wait at the Altar, ſhould be partakers with the Altar, for we muſt know, that even ſo, God hath ordained, that they who Preach ſhould live of the Goſpel? Therefore if we have fail'd to do this, let us ask God's Pardon, and don't let us, becauſe the Miniſter can't exact it, take that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and pay nothing? Secondly, have we ſhew'd our compaſſion to the poor, by giving Alms? Have we not turned away our Face from our Brother who was in need, but been merciful after our
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:180424:77"/>power? If our Hearts condemn us not, we have confidence in God that he is Righteous, and will not forget, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us in the day of neceſſity; thus may we turn theſe excellent Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into heads of Examination, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are we if we have offer'd up ſuch Sacrifices as are acceptable. The Church has taken care to tell us what they are, and has placed them at the beginning of this excellent Office to exhort us to Good Works. We are about to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that exceeding love of Chriſt, and the wonderful charity of our Saviour, therefore 'tis very proper in the entrance to this Holy Ordinance, to exhort us to be like minded, that our Lights may ſhine before men, and the world may ſee the love of God dwelleth in us, by our readineſs to perform his commands; but what need we of Arguments to preſs us to that which is ſo reaſonable in it ſelf, which the Law of Nature teaches we ought to do. But a ſad experience informs us, that neither the law of God nor nature is ſufficient to oblige ſome tempers to compaſſion; but let all ſuch remember, however ſerviceable their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates are to them in this World, they will turn to their deſtruction in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:180424:78"/>their full Barns that have been ſhut at the knockings of the Poor, will then be of no advantage, nor the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their riches prevail for their ſecurity, both of them will turn to their reproof, the ruſt of the one, and full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the other will ſink them into deſpair, and exclude them to Eternity from the Happineſs of God.</p>
               <p>We have been taught that no one muſt approach this ſacred Feaſt in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of Spirit, we muſt have love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Brethren, and if we are in charity with all men, ſhall more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially have bowels of compaſſion to thoſe who are in want; therefore let us while we have opportunity, impart of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and bleſs God for enabling us to do good to the Houſe-hold of Saints; and this coming from us ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, will be the more acceptable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, for God loves a chearful giver, and that our Alms aſcend not alone; 'tis neceſſary we accompany them with Prayers, and though we have no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to aſſure us they come up before God, yet we need not doubt their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, for God himſelf has aſſured us with ſuch ſacrifices he is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, therefore let us humbly ſay, <hi>[at the giving our Alms.</hi>

               <p>After the ſentences are read, we have nothing to do, but devoutly compoſe our ſelves, and joyn with Reverence to the Prayers of the Church; if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſubſtance of this excellent Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, we ſhall be freed from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which often occur in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions; for when our minds are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up with the ſignification of the words, we ſhall have leſs room for wandrings. When the Prayer for the whole ſtate of Chriſt's Church is begun, let us intereſt our ſelves in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent form, that when the Prieſt comes to beſeech God to accept our Alms and Oblations, let us in our minds humbly beg it for Jeſus Chriſt his Sake, and that together with them, God would receive our Prayers for the Univerſal Church; for we can't but enlarge our Paſſions, and deſire the good of all Mankind, not only of thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt, but that the Heathen may be
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:180424:79"/>brought into the Poſſeſſion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and agree in the Truth of his Holy Word; we muſt deſire the Well-fare of Princes, becauſe they are ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us by God, for the puniſhment of Vice, and the praiſe of them that do well; and for the Paſtors of the Church, there is a great deal of reaſon for us to pray for them, that they may duly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter this Holy Myſtery, and by their Example and Doctrine, both ſave themſelves and thoſe who hear them; they who are in Affliction call for our fellow-feeling, and ſince we are all of one body, we can't let any member be in diſorder, and neglect to procure its remedy; we are paſſionately to deſire the Health and Salvation, not only of thoſe we know want preſent relief, but to all that are in any danger, Sickneſs, or other Diſtreſs, conſidering it may be our condition, and we muſt deſire it with the ſame Ardour, as if it was for our ſelves; and ſince God has given us the example of good Men, who are gone before us, we ought to pray that we may follow their ſteps, that ſo we may arrive to the ſame degree of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, and to obtain all this more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly; we are to beg it in the name of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:180424:79"/>Jeſus Chriſt, believing that God will never refuſe any thing that is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for us, when we call upon him in that moſt prevailing Name, eſpecially ſince he is our Advocate, we have the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his interceſſion, and God can deny nothing to the Son of his Love.</p>
               <p>After this excellent Prayer is over, we are exhorted by the Miniſter to a more ſerious preparation to the Communion, though 'tis ſuppoſed that every one who approaches this Holy Table, has conſidered before, repented and got a competent underſtanding in this ſacred Myſtery, yet it is very neceſſary we ſhould attend this Exhortation, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examine our ſelves whether we are ſuch as the Goſpel requires. The Church has taken care to inſtruct us in this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſuch a manner, that we can't eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceive our ſelves; ſhe encourages us with rewards, and ſets before us the dreadful conſequence of our careleſneſs or neglect. We may be over aw'd in our private Examination, by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of our Luſts, or perhaps the love of our ſelves may incline us to think better than we are; but when we hear God's Miniſter urging us to this Duty, and powerfully repreſenting thoſe things
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:180424:80"/>we have prevailed with our ſelves to paſs over, and that God is immediately preſent to acquit or condemn us, we are obliged to confeſs our Wickedneſs and be ſorry for our ſin; this is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance we ſhan't be aſhamed of, that will put us in a ſtate to be reconciled with our Saviour, and make us fit to receive the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and the benefit of that is, the becoming one with him, and to be pertakers of his Everlaſting Glory; therefore when we hear the Prieſt exhort us, <hi>Judge therefore your ſelves Brethren,</hi> let us humbly ſay, I confeſs my ſelf a ſinner, and condemn my ingratitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Repent you truly of your ſins paſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I repent, O Lord, and am ſorry for my Wickedneſs; <hi>Have a lively and ſteadfaſt Faith,</hi> &amp;c. I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief; <hi>Amend your lives,</hi> &amp;c. O grant me thy Holy Spirit to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my life; <hi>Be in perfect Charity,</hi> &amp;c. I forgive all Men their Treſpaſſes, Lord, do thou forgive me; <hi>So ſhall ye be meet partakers,</hi> &amp;c. O make me a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicant; <hi>Ye muſt give moſt humble and hearty thanks,</hi> &amp;c. I adore thy infinit love to Mankind in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the World by our Lord
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:180424:80"/>Jeſus; <hi>who did humble thy ſelf to the death upon the Croſs,</hi> &amp;c. By thy Croſs and Paſſion, ſweeteſt Jeſus deliver me; <hi>He hath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ordained Holy Myſteries as pledges of his Love,</hi> &amp;c. I remember thy exceeding Love to us, miſerable ſinners, and adore thy infinite compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in dying for Mankind; <hi>To thee therefore, O Jeſus, with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt; let us give, as we are moſt bounden; continual thanks, ſubmitting our ſelves wholy to thy holy Will and Pleaſure; ſtudying to ſerve thee in true Holineſs and Righteouſneſs all the days of our Life;</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>The Prieſt proceeds now to a more immediate invitation, and to ſhow us that we ought to think highly of theſe things, calls only thoſe who have ſuch quallifications as he juſt before told us was abſolutely neceſſary, and that we might not come raſhly, puts it to us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>ye that do truly Repent,</hi> &amp;c. But to heighten our eſteem, and make us more in earneſt with our ſelves; let us imagine we hear Chriſt himſelf invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us, for 'tis the Miniſter in his ſtead, calling us to Repentance, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Humility of Soul; theſe are the Garments wherewith we ought to be
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:180424:81"/>cloathed, and he that comes without them, does but mock God, and we have heard the dreadful effect of that preſumption; 'tis provoking him to plague us with Diſeaſes, and ſundry kinds of Death; we kindle God's wrath againſt us, and his indignation will laſt to Eternity. But that the Terrors of the Lord might fright away none but the impenitent, the Church aſſures us all, they who come with Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, may take the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their comfort, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhorts them to draw near to teſtifie their ſincerity by an humble Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to remove all ſuſpicion of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy, commands, that it be done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our <hi>Knees</hi> with contrition. They who hope for Pardon can expect it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other Terms, therefore we ought to be very circumſpect, that we don't call upon God with our Lips, when our Hearts is far from him; <hi>the Sacrifice of ſuch Fools only work their Deſtruction.</hi> Don't let us look upon it as matter of form only, that we are to tell God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty a ſad ſtory of our ſelves, and yet in ſuch a manner, as if we were not concern'd for the Sin, nor God for the puniſhment of it. But when we come
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:180424:81"/>to that part of the Confeſſion, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our Offences, by <hi>Thought, Word and Deed,</hi> let us reflect on ſome of thoſe Tranſgreſſions we have repeated moſt, and have moſt cauſe to repent of; let us think of them with ſorrow, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, with a reſolution to forſake them, and a paſſionate deſire to be freed from the Evil of them; let our Hearts go along with our Prayers, and they are ſuch as will inform us of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and being affectionately repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will teach us to be humble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, and that will render us capable of the pardon which follows to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Prieſt.</p>
               <p>'Tis impoſſible to preſcribe Rules for our thoughts in the time of Abſolution, we have a hundred Idea's at once in our Minds, the Soul is full with Tranſport, Rejoycing and Humilliation; we have ſo much to ſay that we are confounded in our ſelves, we know not how to bleſs God enough, are affraid of our wickedneſs, and aſtoniſhed at his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; there is no re-preſenting the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of a Soul in this Religious Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, nor how prevailing the confuſed ſighs of a raviſh'd ſinner are to our merciful God. They who are moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:180424:82"/>of their ſins, can beſt tell what a boundleſs joy ariſes at the thoughts of their forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>But leſt we ſhould have any miſtruſt, becauſe of our ſins, the Church has col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſome comfortable aſſurances from the Goſpel, for 'tis no wonder we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our Pardon doubting and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; we have need of infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to perſwade us of the truth of theſe things, when our fear had ſo caſt us down, that we almoſt were brought to believe that God had utterly forſaken us; we can now cry with chearfulneſs, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, that has not ſo turned his mercy from us, but has ſent his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to call us to Repentance, therefore when we hear the Prieſt ſay, <hi>Come unto me,</hi> &amp;c. Let us humbly ſay, I come unto thee, O Jeſus, eaſe me of my Burthen; <hi>ſo God loved the World,</hi> &amp;c. I believe, Lord ſave me, or I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; <hi>this is a true ſaying,</hi> &amp;c. Mercy, ſweet Jeſus, I am a miſerable ſinner; <hi>If any man ſin.</hi> O thou great advocate of my Soul, <hi>I bleſs thee, and all that is within me, ſhall praiſe thy Holy Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly our affections are ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that we ſhall be zealous to lift up our hearts with joy and gladneſs, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:180424:82"/>now confeſs 'tis <hi>meet and right</hi> to give thanks; to which purpoſe let us ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons our ſtrongeſt affections, that we may with Angels and Arch-angels mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the glorious Name of God <hi>moſt High;</hi> If it be upon any particular Feaſt, as <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> or <hi>Eaſter,</hi> there is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon to ſtrain our ſelves to the higheſt Note, to give thanks for thoſe particular Bleſſings.</p>
               <p>We are now approaching nearer to theſe Holy Myſteries, and muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the greater Reverence, and before we taſt how gracious the Lord is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our unworthineſs to receive him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Habitation. This we can't do in better Words than the Church has provided for us; therefore we are to joyn heartily in the following form, and beg that our <hi>ſinful Bodies may be made clean by his Body, that being ſo prepared, our Souls may be made fit to receive the Lord of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this excellent Prayer is over, let us look towards the Holy Table, and whilſt the Prieſt is ordering the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, <hi>Meditate and be aſtoniſhed at the tranſcending love of Chriſt; let us loſe our ſelves in contemplation of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Myſtery, that Heaven ſhould ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:180424:83"/>to Earth, and Man be united to God; that God ſhould take upon him our Fleſh, die for us upon Earth, and nouriſh us now he is in Heaven. Let us repreſent to our Faith the intollerable ſufferings of our dying Lord, his whole Paſſion upon Mount</hi> Calvary, <hi>and the Agonies of that unknown Sorrow there. Imagine we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him ſtretch'd upon the Croſs, and ſee the Blood iſſuing from his wounded ſide. Behold him grapling with the fury of an incenſed God, and all the furies of the Powers of Darkneſs; and this to redeem us from the Horrors of Hell, which were due to us for Sin and Wickedneſs. Sure the conſideration of theſe things will create an odiouſneſs of ſin, which was ſo great, that nothing but the Blood of God could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate; we ſhall be ſenſible of our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and adore withall, the forces of our Soul that love ſurpaſſing knowledge, and beg of our crucified Redeemer, to inſpire us with holy Zeal, that our now ſoftned Souls may Eccho Hallelujahs, and all that is within us may ſing Eternally to God the Father, who contrived this glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, to God the Son who effected it, and to God the Holy Ghoſt, who gives us the benefit thereof.</hi>

               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:180424:83"/>
               <p>Let us now return with the Prieſt, and earneſtly beg of our merciful God, that the Elements may really become what they repreſent. After we have performed that with Devotion, let us leave the reſt to God and the Prieſt, and riſing from our <hi>Knees</hi> at the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, look toward the Holy Table de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly, attending every Word and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for all is Myſtery, and deſerves a particular Meditation; let us imagine we hear our Saviour conſecrating, and that we like his Diſciples at the laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, are waiting to be fed with the Bread from Heaven, when we hear the Prieſt, ſaying, <hi>Who in the ſame Night he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, took Bread,</hi> &amp;c. Let us adore that inexpreſſible love of our Saviour, which was working our Salvation when his curſed Enemies were contriving his Crucifixion; let us bleſs the goodneſs of God, and admire the Humillity of our Saviour that would be repreſented by no richer preparation than Bread. Here is no coſtly ſacrifice to exhault our Treaſure, That, we may beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that want it, the poor which we have always with us; but for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of himſelf, he chuſes what is neceſſary for our ſuſtinance, to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:180424:84"/>ſhow us that his Body is as neceſſary to the ſtrengthning of our Souls, as Bread for the ſupport of our Life; <hi>And when he had given thanks, he breakt it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O bleſſed Jeſus, doeſt thou give thanks for my Redemption, behold I joyn my praiſes to thine, and bleſs thee with all my Soul; O ſhew thy acceptance of my praiſes, by hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing theſe Elements to the purpoſes they are deſigned.</hi> Saying, <hi>Take, Eat, this is my Body which is given for you,</hi> &amp;c. Here let us reflect upon the paſſion of our Saviour, and imagine we ſee him in that unſpeakable Paſſion, offering up his pious Soul upon the Croſs. <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O Jeſus, let me never be ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to forget thee, likewiſe alſo, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Supper, <hi>He took the Cup, and when he had given thanks,</hi> &amp;c. Our Saviour was not content to give us his Body alone, but to pour out his Blood for us, and has choſen Wine for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of that ineſtimable mercy. O let our Souls thirſt after this Cup of Salvation, and when the Miniſter holds it out to bleſs it, let us call upon the Name of the Lord; <hi>He gave it to them,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> This is the time

O let us conſider this price with which we were bought, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in our Bodies and Spirits which are his; therefore bowing our bodies before the Lord, let us conſider the wonder of his love.</p>
               <p>BEhold what kind of love, O my Soul, is expreſſed by thy Redeemer, when our ſins, his treacherous Servants, and enraged Enemies were contriving his Death; he was deſigning an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent benefit for us, the ſtream of his affections was ſo ſtrong, that our baſeneſs and ingratitude could not check it; we might have expected that the horror of this diſmal Night ſhould have made him repent of his undertaking, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:180424:87"/>have put him upon reverſing all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer favours; but lo, he adds a greater than ever he had given before, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points this as a ſeal to confirm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the reſt to us.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:180424:88"/>paſs not by me; as thou takeſt this Bread, ſo didſt thou take thy Body only to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Sacrifice for us, and in Sacrament to us; let me not therefore want my part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O Eternal Word of God, by whoſe power all things were made, I will not ask how thou canſt give me thy Fleſh to eat, becauſe, I am abundantly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in thy ſaying, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> ſince thou canſt make it become to me, whatſoever thou ſayeſt it is. I believe Lord, help my unbelief; what though my ſenſes aſſure me the outward ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and its accidents ſtill remain, yet, my Faith and experience tell me, there is an Efficacy therein beyond the power of any other thing. Alas! the Fleſh would profit me nothing, for he that is joined to thee muſt be one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. O let theſe ſacred Symbols there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make me partaker of thy Nature, and a partner in thy merits; let them unite me to thee, ingraft me in thee, and make that Body mine which did ſuffer Death for me, and then I ſhall need no further, but be more happy than if I could underſtand all myſteries; ſure I am, this is thy Body in Sacrament, it communicates to us the bleſſings and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:180424:88"/>benefit thereof, and though preſented with a Figure, and by a Holy Right, yet it is to all its purpoſes, that which it doth repreſent; I will therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as thy Body, and eſteem it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly above all other food, that I may not be judged for not deſcerning thy Body: O let it be unto me according to my Faith.</p>
               <p>I Am a ſinful Wretch, O Lord, and yet if I bid thee depart from me, I baniſh all true happineſs from my Soul; I long for thy preſence, but how ſhall I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain thee? Thou waſt born of a pure Virgin, wraped in clean Linnen, dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt now where nothing defiled can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but never was there ſo unworthy a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>partment prepared for thee, as my pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted heart, into which I durſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to bring thee, but that I know thou canſt make it clean; however, when by Faith I ſee that Body which all the Angels in Heaven worſhip, I cannot but abhor my ſelf in Duſt and Aſhes, I am amazed to ſee ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty come to viſit a Sin-ſick Soul in ſo poor a Cottage, yea, I cannot but trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at thy preſence, O thou King of Glory, becauſe I am ſo overſpread with the filth of ſin, but I will lament thoſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:180424:89"/>corruptions which I cannot fully purge away, and beſeech thee not to diſpiſe me though I deſerve it. I confeſs my ſelf unworthy, but thy condeſention in ſtooping to me will be the more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and if thou haſt leſs delight in me for the preſent, thou ſhalt have more Glory afterwards; <hi>When thou haſt chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my vile Body, and made it like to thy glorious Body, according to thy mighty Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O My Soul, make haſt, behold thy gracious Maſter is dealing his Bread to thoſe that hunger after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; be not diſcouraged at thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, for he gives to all Men libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and upbraideth not. O dear Jeſus, give me a ſhare thereof, declare me to be thine, by feeding me at this Table, thou, who wert content to be bruiſed and broken to ſatisfie my offended God. O be pleaſed to give thy ſelf, and the merits of this thy Paſſion unto me; Lord, give me ever more of this Bread.</p>
               <p>HOly Jeſus, I am not worthy to touch this <hi>bleſſed Body,</hi> as 'tis thine yet I preſume to approach, becauſe thy love hath made it mine. This is the ſacrifice for my ſins, the price of my
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:180424:89"/>Redemption, and that by which my Soul was ranſomed from Hell, and reſcued from a dreadful deſtruction (it was given for me) and it ſhall now be given to me, and haſt thou made ſuch a preparation for me, and offer'd it unto me. Lord, I am tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at thy love, dear Saviour, I will love thee with all my powers, and ſtrive and pray that I may love thee more, as fervently as ever any thy Saints have done; I will give my ſelf unto thee, and diſpiſe all other things in compariſon of thee, and when I have once taſted of this all-ſaving Sacrifice, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for me, I'm perſwaded that neither Life, Death, Pleaſure or Pain, things preſent or to come, ſhall be able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate me from the Love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O My Celeſtial Food, the bread that came down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> how does thy ſweetneſs and my own neceſſities invite me? My body is liable to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, my Soul to Eternal Death; and behold here is the medicine of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, which will remove the ſting of the firſt, and deſtroy the power of the ſecond, which will fill me with the Graces I want, fit me for the Glory I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:180424:90"/>deſire, and advance my Soul and Body above the Power of corruption; I feel a mighty Hunger created in me, which nothing but this Heavenly Manna can ſatisfie. I deſpiſe the meat which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes and feedeth for Deſtruction, and long with impatience to taſte of this Body of Chriſt, of which I may eat and live for ever, which will make the Grave unable to hold me, and Hell not dare to ſhut its Mouth upon me. O make no long tarrying, but give me now and ever this Bread; I deſire nothing but Chriſt, if I want this repaſt, ſhall faint or die before I come to the Mount of God.</p>
               <p>O My Soul, behold how thou haſt incenſed the Majeſty of Heaven; ſee thy Saviour offered up for thy ſins, and ſubmitting to the heavy Wrath of God, and yet whatever he ſuffered was thy Portion; Wretch that I am to live in ſuch a manner, that nothing elſe could ſatisfie or make my Peace, but here I come this day to call my ſins to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; I will look on thee whom I have pierced with a moſt tender and ſympathizing Affection, and while I break this Holy Bread with my Teeth, will commemorate how thou waſt brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:180424:90"/>for our iniquities, how our offences did torture thee with grief and pain. Holy Saviour, I'm angry at my ſelf, and full of anguiſh to ſee what I have brought upon thee; I'm ſorry with all my heart, that I have given harbor to thy Murderers, but I hope this diſmal ſpectacle ſhall mortifie in me all deſires after Evil, and make me abhor all thoſe deſperate pleaſures which muſt be ſo dearly paid for by thee, or ſtand charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my account for ever.</p>

               <p>I Have made a large Collection of Meditations and Prayers, becauſe of the difference of Congregations; ſome are very numerous, and I eſteem them pertinent to regulate our thoughts in that interval before we go up to the Altar; the leſſer Congregations, and they who are deſirous to be firſt at the Holy Table, may have advantage of variety, and make uſe of them as their inclinations and opportunity will give leave. Our thoughts are not always upon the wing, we require diverſity of Arguments to preſs us to a forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, beſides they are not deſigned that our mind ſhould be wholly taken up with them, that we ſhould read them all, and then think we may ſafely go up to the Altar of God. The beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure in the World will be inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, if we don't offer it with Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Sincerity and Affection; one of theſe Petitions rightly performed, is of greater Efficacy than the whole repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Lord, have mercy upon me a miſerable ſinner, ſaid with humility, was more prevalent than the long Prayer of the wordy Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. God knows our neceſſity before we ask, and if we ask with Faith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the incerceſſion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, he will grant our Petitions even before they are ended; ſo that I would have ſome of them repeated with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, and between them call in our thoughts reconcile them to our reaſon and faith, and then offer them up with earneſt devotion, and ſo ſhall we be prepared to receive the Lord of Glory.</p>
               <p>When we have made an end of theſe Meditations, and are ready to go to the Holy Table, riſing from our Knees with Reverence; let us ſay,</p>

               <p>It will not ſuffice me, deareſt Saviour, to receive thee in part only, for I muſt be wholly thine, and bleſſed be thy Name, that thou haſt already given me thy holy Body to cleanſe my Nature; and now thou art preparing thy precious Blood to waſh away my Guilt, my ſins have poured out every drop thereof, wherefore thou preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it to me by it ſelf, to ſhew how truly thou didſt ſuffer Death for me, and now, O my Redeemer, thou haſt ſaid this Cup is the Communion of thy Blood, and thy truth is unqueſtionable, thy power infinite, and thy love was ſuch, as thou gaveſt thy hearts blood for me; I will receive it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:180424:96"/>as the everlaſting Covenant, the Seal of all the promiſes of thy holy Goſpel: I have indeed drunk iniquity like Water, and therefore am unfit to taſt this Water of Life, and yet ſhall periſh without it, for I'me all over defiled, and this is the fountain which thou haſt opened to cleanſe us. I am ſcorched with the Flames of luſt and unruly paſſion, and this is the Cup which thou haſt provided to cool and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh us: What value is ſufficient for me to put upon this immortal Cordial? How can I reverence it enough, ſince the God of Heaven eſteemed it a price ſufficient for millions of periſhing Mankind: My Soul longeth after it, Lord, let me taſte, and my Soul ſhall live; let me waſh in this laver before I come to thy great Tribunal, ſo ſhall I be whiter than ſnow.</p>

               <p>As ſoon as the Congregation has communicated, let us prepare to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Lord together, in order to it, let us reflect upon the Goodneſs of this God, who has done ſo much for us, and if we are attentive to the Prayers of the paſt Communion, 'tis impoſſible to behave our ſelves coldly, or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently; there is ſo much life in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:180424:100"/>that we are forced to utter them with an affectionate concern, and the greater our Zeal, the greater is the Benefit we receive. Each thought muſt give us an Idea beyond our Expreſſion, we ſhall be ſo wholly taken up with this wonderful love of Chriſt, that we ſhall be angry our conceptions are ſo imperfect, that we don't ſee more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Beauty of Holineſs. O let us loſe our ſelves in this boundleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, and be raviſhed with the loving kindneſs of the Lord; and now that we are in earneſt become the Sons of God, we may with confidence lift up our hearts to <hi>Our Father which is in Heaven,</hi> which is the firſt Prayer the Church has appointed to offer up to God; we have been feaſting at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, renewing our Covenants, and made pertakers of our Saviour and his Spirit; therefore being ſo clothed, 'tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per our firſt addreſs be made in his own word. After we have repeated that with Reverence, let us join in the next, for 'tis now high time that we make an offering to the God of our Salvation, and there is nothing we can give more pleaſing than our ſelves to be a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſacrifice; therefore let us intirely
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:180424:100"/>dedicate our Souls, Body and Spirit to the ſervice of God, and be infinitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, that God is pleaſed to accept us therein, and this will enable us more chearfully to joyn in the following Hymne. When our Heavenly King ſees us ſo hearty in his Service, ſo deſirous of Pardon, that we with the greateſt Earneſtleſs, cry to the only begotten Jeſus Chriſt; and with all, ſo forward to return our humble thanks for his Mercy: No doubt he will be near to our Aſſiſtance, and reward us with more than we can ask or think, even exalt us to that ſtate of Glory with him that ſits on the right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is moſt high in the Glory of God.</p>
               <p>After we have thus affectionately joyn'd in the Prayers of the Church, let us with Faith and Thankfulneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Bleſſing, and then with humble Adoration once more magnifie the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, for who can be weary in praiſing the noble acts of the Lord?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>PRaiſe the Lord, O my Soul, and let all thy Powers be acted with ſuch love and wonder, that thou mayeſt break forth into all the expreſſion of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

               </p>
               <p>Let us riſe from our Knees and bow towards the Holy Table, ſhewing our unwillingneſs to depart the place where his Honour dwells, leave it with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance, and ſtill ſay in our hearts, 'tis good for us to be here.

Happy am I that have a ſacrifice of Thankſgiving in my hand, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the delight which my heart doth feel: This Holy Table is the Altar, upon which I offer my Acknowledgmets for all mercies; And Oh, how many, how great are thoſe which this day brings to my remembrance, ſo Infinite it cannot be expreſſed, and yet ſo excellent they muſt not be forgotten: This day hath reconciled Heaven and Earth, and Contradictions made freinds; to find a way to help us, as if nothing might diſagree when Man was at peace with God: O my Soul, ſummon all thy powers to admire and worſhip, for all is Miracle, and the Height of wonder, eternity begins to be; the maker of all is made himſelf; an infinite Majeſty is ſhrunk into the dimenſions of a Span; the Word is made Fleſh, and God becomes Man, yet remains God ſtill: Here is a Mother who knew no Man, a Son that had no Father on Earth; a Child of <hi>Adam,</hi> untainted with the contagion that infects all his poſterity; an Infant honored with a new gloriou,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:180424:102"/>Star; adored by Kings; worſhipped by Angels, yet born in the condition of the meaneſt Fortune: All Hail, ſweeteſt Saviour, How lovely is thy condeſcention? How honourable thy abaſement? Thou haſt more ſplender in the raggs of humility, than all the Grandeurs of this world could give thee; thou art more of a King, becauſe thou wouldeſt be like a Slave for our ſakes, and conquers more hearts by thy ſtupendious Love, and unparalleled ſelf-Denial: O how ſhall I celebrate this great ſolemnity, where withall ſhall I ſet forth my gratitude for this moſt auſpicious Day; I will receive the Cup of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and with faith and raviſhments of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, feaſt upon that precious Body and Blood, which Jeſus did this day aſſume for me: It is not enough, deareſt Lord, that thou waſt born for me, unleſs that alſo thou wert born again in me, and as it were become incarnate in my heart: In thy birth thou waſt made one with us, thou didſt put Fleſh; and wert a partaker of our Humanity, and thou haſt appointed this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I might be one with thee, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with thy Spirit, and a partaker of Divine Nature: Nor is it any incongruity, if I remember thy paſſion, and praiſe thee for thine Incarnation at once; for as ſoon as thou waſt born thou didſt begin to die, and the life which was here begun, compared to that glorious Life which thou didſt leave, was it ſelf a very death for us, which thy Divinity could not feel, and thy Nativity was the firſt Scene of thy paſſion, for it introduced thy Death, and that effected our Salvation, ſo that I will remember both together;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:180424:103"/>in both thou haſt moſt admirably humbled thy ſelf to the depth of miſeries, and yet I doubt not but thou would have ſtupid lower, if it had been either neceſſary or poſſible, but there needs no more Teſtimonies of thy love, bleſſed Jeſus, I am already over-whelmed with theſe that are ſo ſtrange and undeverſed, ſo ſweet and raviſhing, that my Soul cou'd not contain, if it did not vent it ſelf in thy praiſes therefore with Angels.</p>

Thy former Birth ſhew'd thee to be the Son of Man, but this declares thee to be the Son of God, and now that our Redeemer liveth, he that loved us ſo infinitely as to die for us doth now ever live to intercede on our hehalf, he that expreſſed ſuch kindneſs to us in his paſſion, hath ſo fully demonſtrated his own Power in his reſurrection, that we are ſure he is able as willing to deliver us: Let the Heavens rejoice and the Earth be glad, for this is the day that the Lord hath made, a day to be had in everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Remembrance, a Time deſtined to Jubilee and rejoycing: Behold how nature is raiſing it ſelf from the grave of Winter, and ſeems annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to celebrate the memory of our Lord's reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, in her green and freſh attire, a ſeaſon choſen by God, a Feſtival three Thouſand years ago, and Obſerved ever ſince by <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> or both, with the greateſt Solemnity; ſee how thoſe blinded <hi>Jews</hi> rejoyced over their <hi>Paſcal Lamb</hi> in the midſt of all their calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for the deliverance of their Fathers: But we have a nobler Paſs-over, for a greater deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, Chriſt, our Paſs-over is ſacrific'd for us, therefore let us keep the Feaſt, and that upon the precious Body and Blood of the Lamb of God, who is ſlain, but is alive again; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

               <p>O Admirable myſtery! to be adored in the profoundeſt ſilence, by the contemplation thereof; when I am ſtruck with amazement I can learn humility, and diſcover mine own Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and I have the opportunity of exerciſing a Nobler faith than if I could comprehend it with my ſhallow reaſonings, and imperfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, the Trinity in Unity, and the Unity in Trinity hath been derided by the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and endeavoured to be perplexed by the Wits of all kind of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but it ſufficeth me, Bleſſed Jeſus, that thou haſt revealed it, and thy Holy Church, divided into many other things, hath univerſally agreed in thy great Truth, and I am the more confirmed in it becauſe I learn by it to worſhip with a regular devotion, from hence I am the more confirmed: I am taught to pray to the Father in the Name of the Son, through the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, and as long as I live will I praiſe thee, and magnife thee in this manner; I will bleſs thee particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at this Holy Feaſt for ſo excellent a revelation, for this Ordinance it ſelf contains many things above my underſtanding, and its all myſtery; the Trinity is the Article, and thy Sacrament the Rite which do diſtinguiſh thy true Riligion from all the ſects in the World; wherefore, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:180424:106"/>this Rite, I do embrace this Faith, and upon the repreſentation of thy death, I do profeſs to live in it, and die for it, reſolving never to have other Lords; when I find the Father giving, the Son giving, and the Holy Ghoſt diſpenſing that Gift unto my Soul in this ſacred Communion, it ſhall be a greater confirmation to my faith in divine Myſtery, than can be acquired from the moſt curious ſearch into it: However I am reſolved my Reaſon ſhall vail to thy word, and I will be content to ſtay for a full apprehenſion of this ſublime truth, till I am advanced to a State of Angelick perfection, and come to hehold the glories of the true God; till then I will bleſs thee for what I know, and believe more than I can conceive, and I will worſhip the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty which the Heavenly Choir doth, in theſe Addreſſes.</p>
               <p>THE Church has now done her part, and leaves us to diſcharge the reſt, ſhe has told us the benefits, and forewarned us of the danger, let it be upon our own Heads if we have drunk Chriſt's Blood unworthily; therefore let us as ſoon as poſſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and examine our behaviour during the Celebration of theſe Holy Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. How our thoughts were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and how earneſt our longings were after this Bread of Heaven; whether we had duly examined our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:180424:106"/>and repented as we ought, in what part ſoever of theſe things we have done amiſs; let us ask pardon and endeavour to come more prepared the next time. This will ſhow that we are ſincere with God, and don't come out of cuſtom, but for his Grace and Mercy; and let us take every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ask that, for Chriſt is now come very near us, therefore let us lay before him all our wants, that ſo we may be fill'd with his Heavenly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction; let us not loſe a minute on this day, but be earneſt in all manner of ſupplication, for we muſt not leave our Devotions with the Church, that would be ſetting open the door indeed, that <hi>Satan</hi> might enter into us; but I hardly believe, they who have had their hearts kindled at the Altar, can ſuffer them to grow cold before they get home; therefore let us retire, before Dinner, and after we have thus ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reflected upon what we have been doing, let us add to our thoughts the following Meditation.</p>

               <head>A Meditation before Dinner.</head>
               <p>WHen I compare thy acts with mine, Holy Jeſus, I am exceedingly aſhamed to behold ſo a vaſt a diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thou giveſt me, thy Merits and Graces, thy Life and Love at preſent, and haſt promiſed to me thy Kingdom in reverſion, and I have ſcarce return'd this with the intire devotion of one half hour. O how little is my obdurate Heart affected with the ſence of my own Guilt, the fears of thy Divine Wrath, or apprehenſions of thy ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, yet, Lord, I deſire, and did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to praiſe thee, ſo that I hope thou wilt conſider my infirmities with much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and meaſure, my ſervices not by the exactneſs of my performance, but by the ſincerity of my wiſhes, ſo ſhall I be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before thy Heavenly Father, and by the mercy of that acceptance, be obliged to thee for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Moſt merciful Lord God, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at the mighty favours which thou haſt ſhew'd to me a ſinful wretched Creature; I cannot but acknowledge thy goodneſs, though I can make no Retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:180424:107"/>had I all the World at my diſpoſal, I could freely give it all to thee as a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of my unfeigned gratitude, but I hear thy gracious voice, ſaying unto me,</hi> My Son, give me thine heart, <hi>it is not mine, but me thou ſeekeſt; ſinful and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable though I am, yet I am the purchaſe for which Jeſus has left his Glory, laid down his Life, done and ſuffered all theſe things. O marvelous Condeſcenſion! I am nothing, I have nothing, I am void of all Good, full of Evil, and deſerving thy Wrath, ſo that I abhor my ſelf; and canſt thou dwell in me! Be it ſo then, I will diſpute no more with unſearchable mercy, I believe, O my God, and wonder, I can no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt thy condeſcending and almighty love, I will with all the joy imaginable give my felf unto thee, who haſt but lately reſtored me to my ſelf; I have been a priſoner to</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, <hi>a Slave to Sin, and marked out for Deſtructioon; but thou haſt procured my Pardon, Liberty and Life, requiring no more for ſo inexpreſſible a bounty, but that I become entirely thine; had I the life of an Angel, the underſtanding of a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim, or the power of one of thy Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hoſt, thou deſerveſt it all. I'm ſorry I'm no better, yet ſuch as I am, I do moſt freely ſurrender my ſelf unto thee, my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:180424:108"/>and Soul, avowing I will be no more my own, but thy ſervant: O be thou plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to come and reign over me, take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this unworthy heart, I hope I ſhall never be ſo unjuſt, perjured and ſacrelegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as to rob thee of my ſelf hereafter; it is indeed a miſerable gift that I offer, a defiled Body, and a ſtained Soul, but 'tis all I have to give, all that thou requireſt, and 'twill be the better for being thine; let me never have another Maſter, let me never ſully, that which the Blood of Chriſt hath waſhed, nor ſell that to</hi> Satan <hi>which Jeſus hath bought for God. Grant me therefore, gracious Lord, that I may find by the workings of thy Spirit within me, that thou haſt accepted me; give me ſuch help from thee, to confirm my hope, that I may always perform my vows, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rob thee of that which I have dedicated in the ſincerity of my Soul: I am thine, O ſave me for thy mercies ſake,</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p>This Day is appointed to be obſerv'd as a <hi>Feſtival;</hi> and I would have no <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> ſo miſtake himſelf, as to keep it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: But ſince it is likewiſe a Day to be kept holy to the Lord, we muſt not indulge our ſelves over-much, leſt we run into another Errour, and make us uncapable of ſerving God, or our ſelves as we ought, by turning our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonable Service into ſleepy Devotions. And ſince I'm ſpeaking of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> it can't be unneceſſary to lay down ſome Rules for our Obſervation of it. There is no <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but muſt lament the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Neglect of it; for one ſort ſpends it in unneceſſary Buſineſs; the other, in impertinent Recreations; and even they who are more reſerv'd, and ſeem to have a greater Senſe of Religion, are apt to make large Allowances, that except the Time ſpent in the Church, there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beſtow'd on any Act of Religion. The <hi>Church</hi> requires our Belief of the <hi>Morality of the Sabbath;</hi> and if we were perſuaded that 'tis a Day ſet a part by God himſelf, for his own Service, we ſhould have leſs Inclinations to lay out ſo much of it in our own: We muſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively believe our Obligations to God on this Day, and reſolve, that the Time
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:180424:109"/>we don't ſpend in the Church, ſhould devoutly be employ'd at home. We ſhould ſeparate our Thoughts from the Concern of this World: In the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, earneſtly beg of God that we may ſanctifie the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> After Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon what we heard; if it was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Matter, reſolve to make uſe of it in our Converſation; if Matter of Faith, examine whether we can give our poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Aſſent to it; if we don't juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, let us endeavour to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inform'd: Let us call to Mind the Benefit of our Creation, Redemption, and whatever elſe may beget in us holy Thoughts, and a fervent Love to God: Let us turn our Thoughts into our ſelves, that we may the better underſtand our Condition towards God; for how is it poſſible to be ſenſible of our Affairs, if we don't ſuffer our Souls to contemplate for their Safety? There are many that can't accuſe themſelves of notorious Crimes, that can anſwer to the poſitive Prohibitions of the Law, <hi>All theſe have I kept from my Youth;</hi> yet if they ſuffer themſelves to go further in their Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, will find Reaſon, with the young Man in the Goſpel, to be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorrowful, though upon another Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:180424:109"/>they will find a diſmal Account of other things to anſwer, and which are as neceſſary to be repented of, as they are to be obſerv'd for the future. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Contemplation is the beſt Way to improve our Underſtanding in the Ways of Goodneſs; there is infinite Variety for our Thoughts to work upon, and all of them exceeding pleaſant: 'Tis this that will make us in love with Piety; and then we ſhall ſoon turn our Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation into Practice. They who are us'd to meditate, find the Satisfaction of their Conſideration: Though 'tis no eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a Man that has wholly bent his Affection to an immoderate Love of this World, to bring under his unruly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; he ſhall hardly begin to think what he is, why he was ſent hither, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is haſt'ning, but he ſhall ſtop in the middle, and the very Thoughts of the preſent, put him upon enjoying it in another manner. So vain and trifling are we when we have given up our ſelves to be miſtaken for a while, that 'tis hard to bring us to our Senſes, and perſuade us we are our ſelves when we become Rational Creatures. I'm unwilling to preſcribe our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> on this Day; 'tis certain we may extend it to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:180424:110"/>all Things of Neceſſity, but then we ſhould be cautious; for we are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch <hi>Latitudinarians</hi> in things that concern our ſelves, that we are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to loſe an Inch of our Liberty; and are apt to think our Time loſt, which is beſtow'd in the Service of God: Our Trade is not then going on, and we are backwarder by one Day in our Affairs of this World, never conſidering we have another Merchandize to care for; but if we can ſecure Wealth enough here, have no great Affection to lay up Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure elſewhere; as if we were afraid our Riches would corrupt there, or our Venture come ſhort of our Expectations. It was the Obſervation of a great Man, That the more exact he was in keeping the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> his Affairs met with the greater Succeſs in the following Week. Whether every Body would be thus hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, I can't reſolve, but am ſure there can be no Danger in the Trial; and if we fail once, it may ſucceed the next: However, there is ſufficient Reward in it ſelf, for we ſhall have the Satisfaction of doing our Duty; and that we can't effect more exactly, than by a devout Meditation when alone, and a ſerious Attention when at Church. They who
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:180424:110"/>have Families, are to inſtruct their Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in their Duty, and ſee they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it; by giving good Examples and Inſtructions, and ſeeing they follow them; for when all is done, the effectual Preachers are Parents and Maſters: Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may give the beſt Counſel, and preach the greateſt Truths; but 'tis they muſt ſee it has its proper Effect in their own Lives and Converſations, and in thoſe that belong to them.</p>
               <p>If this were induſtriouſly practiſed, what Encouragement would it be to the Miniſters to labour more abundantly for the Salvation of their Flock? And how ſhould we all rejoice in the Day of the Lord, that they had neither run, nor labour'd in vain. In ſhort, Our Communion on this Day ought to be free from Lightneſs or Vanity; not in Worldly Affairs, nor Relations of fooliſh Stories, and as little as poſſible in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Talk, no unneceſſary Viſit, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where but when we have an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of doing good. This ought to be our conſtant Care, to apply our ſelves wholly to God and Religion, and avoid every thing as much as poſſible that would take up our Thoughts on any thing elſe. This is truly to ſanctifie the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:180424:111"/>
                  <hi>Sabbath:</hi> And they who can thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, will find the Benefit, even an Everlaſting Reſt to their Souls in Heaven.</p>
               <p>After we have dined, let us retire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and when we have rais'd our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections by a ſerious Contemplation, let us ſay,</p>

               <head>A Prayer after Dinner.</head>
               <p>O Thou All-ſeeing, and moſt holy God! I have been admitted to make my Oblation of Praiſes, and my ſelf, unto thee; and am infinitely concern'd that thou ſhouldſt accept me therein; not for any Merit in me, but for thine own Mercy ſake. O my God, thou knoweſt I have been polluted with Sin, undutiful to thy Commands, unfaithful to my Promiſes, and confederate with thine Enemies; yea, even in the time of theſe holy Myſteries, ſo obdurate and confuſed, that I might juſtly fear, leſt my Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs ſhould make my Sacrifice an Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: I bluſh that I am not fitter: I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I ſhould bring ſo many Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where the Purity of an Angel is ſcarce ſufficient: But I take Sanctuary in thy more obliging Condeſcentions; and becauſe I am ſo unworthy, will endeavour to eſteem my ſelf as vile as really I am in thy ſight. Oh, do not look upon the Defects of a wretched Sinner; but remember thine own Mercies,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:180424:111"/>and accept what thou haſt required of me; and ſo ſhall thy Favour be more illuſtrious, becauſe it is beſtow'd upon ſo evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving a Creature; and the Senſe of my Unworthineſs ſhall enlarge my Thankfulneſs, and make me praiſe thee more than if I had approached thee with all Perfections.</p>
               <p>It is a mighty Favour to me, O God, that thou haſt made Bread to grow out of the Earth, to nouriſh my mortal Body: But, Oh! how far haſt thou tranſcended that Mercy, in giving me the Bread of Life from Heaven, to feed my immortal Soul! Whom was there in Heaven or Earth that I could have wiſh'd for, in compariſon of Jeſus Chriſt! O my Soul, bleſs thou the Lord: I went not to gaze, or taſte of the outward part; but to ſatisfie my Soul, by laying hold of the Merits of my Crucified Saviour; yet I have receiv'd the Elements, and thou haſt made them to me that which I needed, and deſired, even the Body and Blood of thy Son. Oh, how it fills my Soul with Joy to ſee thy Sacred Majeſty appeas'd! But, O merciful God; I tremble in Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe furious Aſſaults which will be made upon me by my Enemies, from whom I am withdrawn. O God, thou knoweſt how often I have return'd to Folly: But if thou pleaſeſt to plant thy Grace within me, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:180424:112"/>ſend thy Bleſſing upon me, I will not fear the Powers of Darkneſs. I have receiv'd that Heavenly Food, which is the Means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying this Grace unto me. I know by this Coeleſtial Remedy, many of thy Servants have been dreadful to the Powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! and thou didſt never caſt off an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soul. Oh, bleſs then this Life-giving Myſtery unto me, that I may find ſuch Power, Strength and Reſolution flowing from thence, that I may ſtand firm to the Purpoſes I have made. Sweeteſt Saviour, I am now thy Servant; Oh, deliver me from Anger, Malice and Intemperance; from Pride, Luſt and Covetouſneſs, and all the Furies which uſe to torture me. O mark me for thine own; and deny me not that Grace which is neceſſary to make me thine. I'm ſure in thee all Fulneſs of Grace dwells, and let it now overflow, that I may receive of thy Fulneſs; and then ſhall I always perform my Vows.</p>
               <p>Gracious God, I have beheld the Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sacrifice which thy Son hath offered for us; I have remembred it, bleſſed be thy Name for it, though not ſo highly as I am oblig'd, for the Benefits are ineſtimable: There is no Want of Merit in Jeſus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, nor of Mercy in thee to beſtow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: Oh, let there not want in me, nor
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:180424:112"/>in any for whom Chriſt died, grace to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this Pardon, Behold, Lord, how I ſtruggle under a load of guilt, but I have receiv'd that which is an effectual remedy, who was ever reconciled to thee, but by Jeſus, or who was ever ſo much thy Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but this Holy Sacrifice has made their Peace, and ſhall it be ineffectual only to me; Dear Father, let me find the Effeca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thereof in my ſelf, and then I ſhall be engaged to praiſe thee more and more for this great Salvation through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>HAving thus renewed our deſires, and fired Souls with an ardent love of Chriſt, let us prepare again to meet the aſſembly of Saints, that we may worſhip God together, and give thanks to his Name, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive new inſtructions for the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Lives, and the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Faith, that we may inlarge our deſires after Heaven, and ſee the pleaſures of the Habitation of the Lord. At our return home, 'twill be neceſſary that we give up our ſelves to a ſerious Meditation of our actions this day, if our heart condemn us not, then have
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:180424:113"/>we confidence towards God; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, let us humbly beg Pardon: Let us be earneſt in this Examination, for 'tis of great moment to be very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect now; don't let us cry Peace when 'tis far from us, and fancy we are reconciled to God, when we are in league with the Devil; for ſo every one is, that has not been heartily ſorry for his ſins, and ſeriouſly intended a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Life; we muſt not think our ſelves perfect becauſe our affections are raiſed, and we ſeem to have a zeal for the Glory of God, for no one can approach this ſolemnity without tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; if we examined our ſelves before entertained Reſolutions of Repentance, and come with Faith and Humility, though during the Celebration of theſe Myſteries, we had Wandrings, evil Thoughts and Diſturbances; yet if we ſtruggled with them then, and are ſorry for them now, God will receive us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his favour; therefore 'tis very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary we ſhould now call our ſelves to an account, be ſorry for the ill, and bleſs God for the good, which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be done in the following form.</hi>

               <p>O God the Father of Heaven whoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is over all the World, I am infinitly pleas'd to behold thy Glory, and to hear the praiſes which thou haſt gotten by thy mercy to poor ſinners, and I could even pour out my Soul in the manifeſtation of that joy which my heart conceives at thy univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Honour; wherefore I will praiſe thee by Acknowledgments, bleſs thee with
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:180424:115"/>Hymns, worſhip thee with the loweſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and glorifie thee to the utmoſt of my Power. I will give thanks unto thee with all my Soul, for thy Pitty, Patience, and Mercy towards thy unworthy and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Creatures. How ſhall I expreſs thy welcome into my Soul, bleſſed Jeſus? Or how ſhall I celebrate thy Praiſes? I will remember what thou art in thy ſelf, and what thou haſt done for us: O thou Eternal and only begotten Son of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the Father, who art thy ſelf both Lord and God. How lovely art thou, O thou innocent Lamb of God, encircled with Millions of redeemed Souls, whom thou haſt waſhed in thy Blood? O how il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious a Brightneſs ſhines round thee, whilſt thou art in the midſt of all thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs interceeding for poor Sinners. I adore thee, and long to do thee Honour, my Lord and my God; hear then my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate ſupplications, and enable me to proclaim the goodneſs of the Lord.</p>
               <p>BLeſſed Jeſus, the Author and finiſher of our Faith, who art the ſame Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday as to Day, and for ever; thou haſt given Spiritual means to thoſe that fear thee, and wilt ever be mindful of thy covenant, but my goodneſs is as a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:180424:115"/>Cloud which ſoon paſſeth away; my Devotion fleeth like a ſhadow, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver continueth in one ſtay; Oh, do thou eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh me with thy free Spirit, that I may not ſo eaſily forfeit my Comfort, forget my Duty, and break my Vows; how unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed art thou deareſt Saviour, in doing well unto me? How conſtant is thy Love, and ſhall I be ſo ungrateful to thee, ſo cruel to my ſelf, as to forſake thee, and my own Happineſs? I fear the Power and Policy of mine Enemies, I do with ſhame and ſorrow call to mind my former returns to folly. I moſt paſſionately entreat thee not to leave me to my ſelf, I have, through thy goodneſs, now obtained ſome meaſure of Peace; my Eyes are enlightned, my Heart revived, and my purpoſes ſeem to be ſincere; give me thy grace therefore that I may be able to perform whatſoever I have promiſed, that I may be ſteadfaſt, unmovable, always abounding in thy work; O Lord, let me hold faſt that which I have, and daily ſtrive to gain more; make me faithful to Death, that thou mayeſt give me a Crown of Life.</p>
               <p>Now the God of Peace which brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from the dead our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the Blood of the everlaſting Covenant;

            <head>THE CONCLUSION</head>
            <p>HAving thus begun our Courſe, <hi>Let us run with dilligence the race that is ſet before us;</hi> 'Tis now that we are begun to be Chriſtians, and let us be very cautious how we diſcredit the holy Name by which we are call'd: 'Tis not ſufficient to aſſume the Title, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out departing from Iniquity to compleat the Character: Therefore at our return to the World, let us have the mercies of God in continual remembrance; let that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which has ſo far led us on to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, move us to be zealous in his ſervice, and prevent our ingratitude, by keeping our ſelves from every evil work.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider, that we are bought with the price of the Blood of Jeſus, and looking upon our ſelves ſo redeem'd, let us not ſell our ſelves any more to work wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider the dignity of our Nature; that God has made us but a little lower than the Angels; that we only came into this World in order for a better; that we were born on purpoſe to be eternally happy; Why then ſhould we do any thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:180424:117"/>our ſelves, and make us uncapable of that bleſſedneſs, which the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of Heaven has prepared for us? The conſideration of this will lead us to praiſe God for our Creation, which we ought ſincerely to do, and ſhall want no motives to offer up our Thankſgivings, if we conſider the ineſtimable benefits we may receive by it.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider we are but begun in our way to Glory; that to falter in our purpoſes wou'd endanger our ruin; and to return, wou'd be to loſe the glorious pains we have been at in our converſion: All thoſe Prayers and Tears, Faſting and Alms-givings, which enter'd Heaven in our behalf, and by the interceſſion of our Saviour, done ſo great things for us, will turn to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; be a terrible accuſation of our hypocriſy, and baniſh us to eternity from the preſence of God; beſides, how can we expect to attone Heaven, if we ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a ſecond Repentance, when all our former Vows prove falſe? Won't God be deaf to our complaints, when they are uſher'd in by ſuch treacherous Advocates? Can feigned tears move compaſſion from that God, who is a lover of truth? What form of Prayer will ſerve our turn, when we have made uſe of the beſt compoſures as a mock to the Judge of Heaven? Oh, Chriſtian! ſince thou haſt approach'd the Altar of God, and there vow'd a perpetual Obedience to his Will, as thou hopeſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:180424:117"/>Heaven has heard thy petitions, and ſign'd thy releaſe; as thou believeſt thou haſt eat the Fleſh, and drunk that Blood of Chriſt, and by that incomprehenſible Myſtery art united to our Saviour Jeſus; as thou hopeſt from this wonderful mercy to be raiſed at the laſt day to Eternal life, live worthy of thy Calling, by a perfect ſubmiſſion to the Will of God, and a holy perſeverance in his ways, make thy Election ſure. Since thou haſt thus put on the Armour of God, and taken to thy ſelf the ſheild of faith; reſiſt the World, the Fleſh, and Devil, and thou ſhalt at laſt reap that reward which is laid up for thoſe who have continued in well doing, and by their conſtancy in ſome ſort merited, that eternal Gift of God, which is a Crown of Glory in endleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable joys.</p>
            <p>Let us endeavour to fill our Souls with all vertues, and when we are ſo happy as to have our inclinations after goodneſs, that we have a fondneſs for the Glory of God, and habituated our ſelves in his ſervice, we ſhall find the advantage of our converſion; for beſides the inward peace and ſatisfaction, which is the reſult of a pious mind, we may enjoy with more pleaſure the Goods of this World, than when we gave a looſe to our deſires, and were led captive by our luſts; when we ſo induſtriouſly perſue our happineſs, we ſhall arrive to that degree of goodneſs which will make it as uneaſie and difficult to commit wicked actions,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:180424:118"/>as 'twas at firſt hard to refrain them. We ſhall have an averſion to Vice, and ſee our weakneſs and folly that cou'd be ſubject to its embraces; it will then loſe all its charms, and we ſhall yield to that divine Truth, that God is only to be loved; that Religion is our wiſeſt choice; that to be happy is to underſtand her, for her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace. This indeed is what very few believe, Men generally frame an auſtere Notion of Religion, think it ties them up from the buſineſs and pleaſure of this World; they have an inclination to ſerve God, but think he requires ſo much of their time, that they have but little for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or Families: This may be one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſome are ſo religious by fits, they are mighty zealous againſt an <hi>Eaſter,</hi> or any particular time of Devotion, but as ſoon as the Seaſon is over return to their former habit of indifference, and can give no other reaſon, but that their Buſineſs calls them off, as if Devotion conſiſted in ſaying juſt ſo many prayers; at ſuch an Hour to be in their Cloſſet; to faſt ſuch a day in the week, and to neglect the Affairs of this World, becauſe we can't ſerve <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> Such a Notion of Duty is certainly very prejudicial to the practiſe of Religion: God created this World for our convenience, and did not deſign we ſhou'd be preſerved like the Lillies, which toil not, neither do they Spin, but commanded man to get his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:180424:118"/>bread with the ſweat of his brow, and can we think his labour ſhall be turn'd to his reproof; that whilſt he honeſtly perſues the neceſſary Duties of his Calling that he ſhou'd be accuſed for not imploying that time upon his knees. Providence has ordered very differing circumſtances among men, and to diſcharge with fidelity the Poſt in which he has placed us, is part of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and when juſtly perform'd, as accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as our Devotion; we may enjoy a great deal of this world, and yet be very good Men; nay, by being vertuous, we may make a freer uſe of it; for Vertue teaches a right uſe of every thing, and God has deny'd us nothing that is uſeful, for all things were created for the uſe of man: In ſhort, 'tis not the uſe, but abuſe of this World, that renders us obnoxious to God: We may endeavour after Riches, but not to ſet our hearts upon them. They are given us to do good with, and when we croſs the intent of them, by making them a uſeleſs Treaſure, the ruſt of them will make them to conſume.</p>
            <p>Religion don't tie men up from the Affairs of this World, it only teaches them how to behave themſelvs in it, by preſcribing ſuch Rules which are neceſſary for the quiet or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the World in general, and for a juſt management in particular between men; for the general Government of the World, it teaches us that we ſubmit our ſelves to every Ordinance of Man; that we be not
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:180424:119"/>unruly, ſtiring up ſedition by ſpeaking evil of Dignities; and it comprehends the Church Government, as well as State, by conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Order of Men who are to watch for our Souls, and for that reaſon we are to Obey them that have the rule over us in the Lord. Thus, by obeying Our Spiritul Paſtors, and Temporal Maſters, we ſhall at laſt receive the Reward of our Obedience; but they who reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation: For the particular management of our ſelves amongſt our Neighbours, we are, if poſſible, to live peaceably with all Men; to be juſt, and Charitable, and in every thing to do as we wou'd be done by; to be dilligent in our Calling, and by an honeſt induſtry provide for our Families. We are not to be ſolicitous for the Morrow, nor by a carping care after this World neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the other: If we are ſucceſsful, let's look up to him who is the giver of all good things, for his is the hand that ſows the ſeed, and his the hand that gives the Bleſſing. If we have loſſes, and become poor, let us ſubmit with Patience, and reſign our ſelves to his Wiſdom, ſtill relying upon his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Such a Contentment may move the compaſſion of Heaven to raiſe us again in this Worlds eſteem, or what's infinitly better, remove us from the preſent Evils, to the Joys of his Kingdom. Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that we ought to receive Evil as well as good from the hand of God, that he knows what is beſt for us, and why
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:180424:119"/>then ſhou'd we be angry that God does that which is wiſeſt, and moſt fit to be done. Let us caſt all our care upon him, and whatever condition we are in ſhall have moſt ſatisfaction; this is as much a duty, as 'tis pious in it ſelf, and incumbent on the whole race of Mankind. The Rich ought more particularly to have reſpect to it, leaſt they ſuffer by their confidence, and truſting in the Multitude of their riches be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded: The Mighty, that they mayn't be brought low; and thee Poor, leaſt God forget their Cry. <q rend="inline">Oh, how happy are they who can with confidence look up to God, that can uſe this World, neither abuſing it, nor themſelves; by making it a hindrance to their Religion, and by an unaccountable extravigance, make that miſerable change of their Souls for their Vanity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let us firſt ſeek the Kingdom of God, and his Rightouſneſs; looking upon our ſelves as born for another World, and that we are only in our Paſſage thither. Cou'd we but perſwade our ſelves of this truth, we ſhou'd remove our affection, and make uſe of this World, but as it ſerves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us to a better. To what purpoſe ſhou'd we ſtrive to heap up riches, when we know not who ſhall gather them? Why ſhou'd we be coveteous to eſtabliſh a Name, when the Glory of this World ſo ſoon paſſes away? Let us do all poſſible good in our Station, endeavouring to be exemplary to the preſent Age, and not be ſolicitous
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:180424:120"/>for the ſounding of our fame to the future: That can't affect us, for we ſhan't be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it; or if we were, can it add to our happineſs in Heaven, or ſhall we have leiſure to be pleaſed with our own Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, when we ſhall be in veiw of him, in whoſe Preſence is fullneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more: But after all, our Vertuous Actions muſt have another motive than Popular applauſe; for if we do our good Deeds to be ſeen of Men, we have our reward; we can have no retribution of our good works that are not with a deſign to the Glory of God; we muſt do them, becauſe God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them, and is beſt pleaſed when ſuch Devotions are offer'd up for his ſake: It ſhows our conformity to his Will, when our obedience proceeds from a ſenſe of our Obligations to him, and then he that gives a Cup of cold water in his Name, ſhan't loſe his reward. The Mercy of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in this, nor that we loved him, but that he loved us; and can we be too grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the inexpreſſible love of the Father? Can we propoſe a greater advantage than we ſhall receive at his Hands, or ſuppoſe 'tis not honourable to be juſt, for we rob him of his tribute, and make our Vanity the occaſion of the Good. The folly of this is too groſs to have any Advocates, for tho' Men love to blow the Trumpet that have it found in the Name of God: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us be good, becauſe God is ſo, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:180424:120"/>this will put us upon every opportunity to pleaſe him, that we may by a conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Vertues, mould our ſelves more and more into the likeneſs of him, in whom God was ſo well pleaſed, becauſe he went about doing good.</p>
            <p>It concerns us who have gone thus far in the way of Holineſs, that have ceaſed to do Evil, and began the pleaſant exerciſe of doing Good, to endeavour the performing it in the moſt acceptable manner. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture gives us direction, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Example to encourage us; let us therefore look up to that pattern of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that we may as much as poſſible be Holy, as he is Holy, and we ſhall find him ſumming up all in this one word, <hi>Love.</hi> 'Tis Love, that is the great Duty of the New Law, and abſolutely neceſſary to be ſtuddied by all who intend to be ſaved: We ſhall have no excuſe for our Ignorance, or neglect of that Duty, which God came on purpoſe to inſtruct and enjoyn. We ought to have it perpetually in our Minds, and never proceed to any action without it. In our Retirements we ought to be thinking of it, becauſe that will prompt us to ſeek ſome new occaſion of our Love, and in our Buſineſs, becauſe then we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver act amiſs; for how can he be guilty of an injuſtice, who has love in all his thoughts, that not only ſtudies to do as he would be done by, but is always conſidering to do the good in his power, without the mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:180424:121"/>of return; for to arrive to the utmoſt of this Duty, we muſt not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what we would have done to our ſelves, but what is fitting for us to do to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This indeed muſt be left to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, but let's have a care of deceiving our ſelves, for our Conſciences are to be our accuſers. Let us remember that we are to ſhew our ſelves Diſciples of our great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, by loving one another, and if we truly do ſo, God will reward us according to our Love; we can't evidence our Relation to him more than by our compaſſions to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous, and we are aſſur'd that unleſs we put on bowels of compaſſion, we have no right to his promiſe, for if a man ſees his Brother in want, and relieves him not, how dwelleth the love of God in him. Let us conſider that we are all of the ſame Body, that Chriſt died for us all, and therefore 'tis not fitting any one member ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. Chriſt came to procure to himſelf a peculiar People, <hi>Zealous of good Works,</hi> and we muſt not reckon our ſelves as his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, till we can ſubmit to his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Great Men have it in their Power, to relieve the Diſtreſſed, to be merciful to the Poor, and to be a Friend to the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Widow; the Poor muſt not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their part, by being grateful to their Benefactors, and faithful in their Truſt, by being humble, obedient and contented, for Love teaches us all things; if we could but poſſeſs our minds of this excellent Virtue, it
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:180424:121"/>would abate the ſwelling of our Ambitions, it would inform the Proud that 'tis nothing but his conceit which advances him above his Neighbour, and inform the indigent, that nothing but an inward peace and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is to be deſired by thoſe who have any underſtanding, for <hi>Love's the generous Vertue of the Mind.</hi> If Men believed this, they would not ſo much labour after a great Name as a Good, nor deſire riches ſo much to advance their Families, as to benefit the Neceſſitous. They would not covet to be Great for the ſake of Honour, and a gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Retinue, but to have it in their power to be Juſt, to advance Merit, and give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Deſert. Great Men, tho' they have no Employment, have leaſt occaſion to be Idle; if their Country don't require their Immediate ſervice, they have the more time to attend their better part; let God receive their leiſure, and the publick be the better by their Piety. If God has Bleſſed them with great Eſtates, and raiſed them to great Dignity, they have the more reaſon to be diligent, in employing their Honour and Fortune to his Service; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them to manage with caution, and not turn the bounty of God into Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; they are to give an account of their Stewardſhip, and where much is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, much will be required; it was given them that they might have an opportunity to do good, and they have the bleſſing of God here and hereafter for their Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:180424:122"/>How ought they then to adore the goodneſs of God, that has put it ſo much in their power to be Happy, by giving them a valuable bleſſing here, as an earneſt of a future Reward. But we are not to think that Charity belongs only to great Men, 'tis true, they have it in their power to excell Men of leſs condition, but we are all to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of this world's good, as God has put in our power; and tho' we can't do great things, let us do what we are able; there is an obligation even upon the poor themſelves, to afford what help they can to aſſiſt their Brother in Diſtreſs; in ſhort, if we have Love, that will teach us all that is owing to our ſelves or Neighbour, that ſo we may live as becomes thoſe who profeſs that Goſpel of Chriſt in all manner of Holy Converſation; to let the love of God dwell in us richly, and endeavour to a ſimilitude of him, who is the expreſs image of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is Love.</p>
            <p>Having conſidered that 'tis both our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and intereſt now we are arrived thus far, to perſevere to the end, that we may be ſaved; that in order to it we muſt fill our ſelves with all Vertues, and that the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them is Love; let us reſolve with all our Souls to proſecute theſe conſiderations to purpoſe; let us not think we ſtand too ſecure to be ſhaken, but reflect upon our former weakneſs, and ſtill ſuſpect our frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein we moſt fear by earneſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; let us make known our requeſt
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:180424:122"/>to God, that he may ſupport us in the day of Danger, and cover us from the aſſaults of our Enemies; we are always to lament our old Miſcarriages, and their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance ought to be grevious. To this end let us continue ſteadfaſt in our Addreſſes to God, and beg that he would ſtill give us a ſenſe of the odiouſneſs of ſin, that ſo we may be deterr'd from committing it. Let us, as much as poſſible, frequent the Church, if our neceſſary Buſineſs will not give us leave to attend her daily Devotions Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening, let us not fail of offering up our private Sacrifice. No Buſineſs muſt intrench upon that, 'tis a right which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God, and if we value our ſafety, we muſt not omit it: Let no Man be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, becauſe he can't attend the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church ſo conſtantly as he would, if we do it but as often as we can, God is no ſuch Task-maſter, but he accepts of our Will and Endeavours. But God knows, People are very apt to take up with Excuſes, and becauſe they hant a mind, will make their buſineſs to prevent their Duty, and they who have leiſure prefer their Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Devotions; and what I admire at moſt, ſome people who frequent the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, very ſeldom approach the Houſe of God but when they go up to the Altar, as if the Church doors were never open but on <hi>Sundays,</hi> or once a Month. How can theſe Men's Religions be ſincere, who have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to give God thanks in the Aſſemblies of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:180424:123"/>his People, and confeſs their ſins among the Congregation of the Lord? How do they live in obedience to the Church, that don't appear at Morning and Evening Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, unleſs unavoidably hindred? And how do they deceive themſelves when they make a lying Excuſe? Let us all, to whom God gives an opportunity, wait on him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in his Houſe; let us obſerve the Faſts, and the Feaſts of the Church, with Reverence and true Devotion, and not bring a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal upon the Church by our ridiculous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes about them; let our Faſts be as ſhe directs, and as God has appointed, and let our Feaſts be kept Holy to the Lord. On Saints-Days, let us commemorate the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings conveyed to us by that Saint we have in Remembrance, at <hi>Eaſter, Whitſunday</hi> and <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> the wondrous Myſteries which the Church commends to our Devotion, and not turn them into Jollitry and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanneſs Let our <hi>Lent</hi> and <hi>Ember Days</hi> be held in Veneration, and if we can't ſtrictly Faſt, let us do all we can for Mortification; let the poor Man and Labourer nor take the opportunity of theſe Seaſons, to ſpend them in his Diverſion; there is no ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as in the Service of God, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect freedom; and ſince Providence has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them other opportunities, let them take theſe to watch for their Souls, and improve them in true knowledge; let not the Rich feed themſelves in Luxury, and make theſe Holy Seaſons an occaſion of greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch,

            <p>Let they who have Families and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren take care to give Examples of Piety, and have ſo much Charity as not to deny them all opportunities of attending the Church, let them have recourſe to God as often as they can, and ſee that publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at leaſt once a day be performed in their Houſes; inſtruct them in Religion, and of the Church; teach them the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Prayers, and to perform them with Devotion; we had need do all we can to bring Religion into Vouge, and pray that God would Eſtabliſh his Church in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Let us ſhow our Zeal for the Glory of God, by promoting of Holineſs among Men, and take care that our Converſation be void of Offence, and give up our time as much as poſſible to Devotion, that by our conſtant Addreſſes, we may be fill'd with God's Grace, and Heavenly Benediction; 'tis to all our Advantages to be upon our Knees, or in Meditation; as frequent as we can; they who know the Pleaſure of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing

The Saints of Old were very Zealous in this Duty; they had their ſet Hours of Prayer, and if we followed their Piety, we might aſſure our ſelves of the like Succeſs. It was <hi>David</hi>'s conſtant practiſe to praiſe God in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Morning, and at Noon-day; and I'm ſure our neceſſities are as urgent as his, and if they who have moſt leiſure would dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their Devotion, and offer up their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices ſix times a day, their labour would not be in vain; beſides, when we are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to this frequent Communion with God, we ſhall be convinc'd with Holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, That the ways of God are exceeding plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,</hi> and be ready upon our Solemn days of Devotion to ſtretch our Zeal to an Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with his, who took up the holy Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of praiſing God ſeven times a day, becauſe of his Righteous Judgments.</p>
